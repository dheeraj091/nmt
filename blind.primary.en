yes , good afternoon , my sister ' sister ,
so , very much , to say , for the waiting
and i have to imagine that now , at
my name is christian gupta , and i 'm a familiar , strangely , galvao with the city
this is called the `` you 're going
and my favorite news is : the trick , the second organization , the new job
so for instance , i 'm in the process of
and that 's exactly what you 're not just
i know i
and that was , and this is a little which my son really like , but is , i
i mean , i said to the president of the
and alisa swam and another wooden
and i 've been thinking about this , of course , is a theme of a theme of what i want
with the subject of my sandwich , because the air that 's led to
we hope for the best and our work on the very first thing that has been to imagine that jack
you know it 's
he was a man who was with
and then i 'm starting to start to understand something that far
i 'm going to pass you
so we 're like , if we 're a risk of individuals , we 're going to be looking at a disaster , which is
many people are currently on
it 's not , it 's illuminating by
and somewhere on the side of this panel , a young , a psychologist , and you have a little
no one seems to be with
the ted boy does n't
suddenly a train train
leave the highlight of the
if you 're going to see ,
people are taking
the owners who
go out and out
what is it ? well , great splashy swiss
we do n't know what we 're looking at , or now
people leave the building building the
children get angry
now , some might even even even even even want it ,
suddenly a funny article
there 's a flip out
and it 's a string
i 'm going to hear a
i 'm going to take that out
but there 's no clue i 've been hearing about , which is
and that 's when this happened in that particular week at
there 's a guy that 's been happening
and then finally , it turns out that only , in berkeley , nine and nine ,
but the people were just so at what a friend was , and so a friend told me that the building
and in fact , nothing
and it happened to be that , in fact , that this became particularly in the group that my friend , my friend
god is never understood if he never understood , otherwise , if they did n't have the whole set of it
you see , in a sense , a binary disaster , communication has a very important good good
now , communication is important because people , in this situation , to write through 400
they want to know what they 're going to
in the past , when we did the good time , the u.s. was just as
we just did n't have anything , or we did
why 's
because the so-called iron is the
and that has to say to me , god , that people will explain to us , we do n't even know the truth or we 'll give the
this is in a period of the social media , in a period of kenya , in a time of private and public , in a time , in a time , and public television is no longer possible to the public
simple and secret , because it 's not a moral one , and probably most of the most important is that we 're working at the last
you might remember the print on the top at the center of the river , and that 's when a
the first report about this was on twitter
so , from someone who was sitting on an egg and you face that , and you have that plane of light , and you have a
that was n't a clear
you see , we 're at risk , today , just today , and that 's how we 're getting the truth of the
because what 's happening is that , of course , we also have the last part of the world , because as we have to , as a disaster , we
it 's not that public media or also private media is either impossible or so they 're not going to do
so , from that , we 're going to eat , and that 's even what has been a media , that 's how we 're going to work in the future
and that 's what we 're going to do on the
it 's just as though that a form
that means that we will be giving up in the next few years of 500 villages in the '50s , which is some of you who are still , notice when there 's the
and then it was then
you may know , what is the biosphere coming , once long , once long , and once long , even
i do n't know anymore anymore
we 're going to be using all of this today with all the world we have in that stage , so that 's why , on facebook , about facebook , about the web , the local media and the way that we 're going to take that , and that 's how we 're going to go and look at
and we know we need to get very quickly and we need to be very quickly and very strong , because the citizens and the citizens , and the citizens that
and we did n't even find any of what we want to say to
in fact , in the crisis and so , in the crisis , the least has a question of how much of the media that we have to stand with , and it 's
so , a problem is that the citizens , because the citizens and the citizens will say , as the defense is again , the driver 's actually better , they 're all , or they say , the more elegant 's time
we 've done some good experiences with facebook and twitter , and recently recently recently recently
so , what you might have done is that , you know ,
we have a bigger big unit that we have found
and that 's an idea that an
these are bombs that are faced with a conditional site , because they just ca n't even get the one attack on the sky , and they 're actually working with the floor of the name of war , the second four years of their paintings that they come from , and then they came out and down the night
the problem is only that , many of these parties have never worked , and as in the case of a number of us
and there we got by a young writer , and that was that we had a long way as we wanted to know that , as we were in the beginning , we were now known as though she was on a nuclear business business , and now she had the climate control that there was a
at that time , several days of japan were set to the
we 'll see what we find everything that all of
that number of cake can be put in place , not being abused , but
and so we then went and set the northern park and truly create a sense of the word , the word , the road
and in the history of the city , the whole thing that 's going on the whole was going to take all over the whole was going to take that whole and
and the media was very famous . and so hearing
we had to do with a date that we have and the iron and the iron and the iron and the
so , this was a great effect for us because , the focus will get the way that the ground
just , you 'll also give me a decision , if i stop at a certain
i ca n't be able to go here at the
that 's the premise , because , of course , the social media has the advantage that they have very information
not so being polite , because the members of the world 's room or the movie of what you call is : a high wave have
secondly , so early and
if something is n't true , this will be anybody who 's actually waiting out the aids that i 've just talked to , because now , the whole energy of the whole thing is the wrong part
and it 's a very big deal , so , if something is wrong , it can also be very fast that it can
and we have a huge firewall of
i said , `` i 'm a very confident scientist , which was the exciting thing , how a bomb
so , from that , we have all of the things that are happening in the last few years , and it 's much more nuanced than a consequence of another , as an artist
the city is a parent from a high basis of birth to a disaster that
a bomb that has come into moscow , in an park , is not that those kind of
but they also , and then once we 're seeing that , we 're going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do this
and if they do , they think about marketing , and if they 're just going to think about other cities , if they have to be caught , they 're just like , they 're not going to be able to do a little bit of it , and we 're already going to be
and to communicate that , it 's important , because it 's just a world in a world that 's just in a world that 's just going to turn to the system , to make sure that people have been able to have that the people who are able to make up on that difficult special situation that they 're working on that difficult special
and social media help us be made , because they 're all about to become related to communications , and not just a philosophical hint of how we 're going to be in the suburbs , `` and also that we 're going to have a big , big part of
so today today is not just a special issue of state , not just a job of the deceased war or the barber , the off , red sea , but you can see that you can see a disaster , and to a cause that a
and the video showed that showed
there 's a lot of twitter and congress on facebook , when they 're just a big part of the aid , although , in fact , they were very much for people to be able to build the whole thing ,
now , what we 're looking at is a lot of time , as far as public cancer , and the middle thing that has been shown with the launch of the world , and that 's where the social media has been shown to a high-speed , from a communication
and i hope that if you have a little bit of mind , that actually , that the -- that the whole , that is , it 's actually a lot of , in fact , that the power of the future is really going to be able to become the citizens , and that 's the first time , and that 's the
you know ,
so , some of my beautiful good
i 'm proposing that i
i 'm a writer and a dreamer , and as you just heard
and i 'm also quite sure that a personal biologist for that in particular ,
what it means is that i get it up , and i think , i can also look at
before i do that , i have to let a couple of things
the first one is , i think , really , that we need stories to life
we can not live without stories , or
i also believe that there 's a lot of more indicators , there , three , three stories , when the research actually actually actually
i think that the internet , the infinite contribution , is as good as not the world 's very serious , it 's going to
and i 'm a writer that i 've become struck by that human beings , that we have
and they are happier , as soon as they give you creative
so more people are happy , and they 're better than they 're
it 's just
and that better world is now just an ice unit
now , in first line , i 'm a writer , that
and the story that i want to say is actually -- begins with a student in a google morning , at some funny fashion
that 's microvascular juan
and it 's thoroughly islamist happily 's
now , they 're now coming from the main cost of the cost of the cost of the cost , and they 're not much at all that stuff , because at
it 's a little bit inside in your head , in your body , with
and she does n't really give words for
you do n't know what 's happening at just
i 've also been interested in
i call that the sound of saint warner
you see on a side of the side , and you see , you see , and
i am so much that i can make the feel of
so alisa
and on the other side , we have the two common in the country with a very large political
and it was at this point that i would better be much and write with you and write that i would
so the first thing that 's happening now is a famous man with the number of blobs that you have , you 're very serious in it , you 're actually saying , `` oh , your life is going to be down
that 's microvascular juan
and it 's shockingly fuller paper that she 's giving up to a very large kind of large
it was an unprecedented , an
so poor people who are poor who are just reading their most successful professional growth
and who 's talking about some
very nice beautiful
imagine that the apple box does n't get into that kind of a thing , if they meet themselves , but from the
so , `` you add it , you know ,
what really matters is that the players did n't actually notice looking at their
we do n't know if we die that we die
i wish that all of a long way , but we do n't know
it 's also all morning that at least ,
and so , it 's also in my position ,
you do n't know anything , even what you can really do ,
that means that every lost will have the last point as the last
a player who has its entire life set up , biking from the moment the northern book of the hull is like a
now , of course , you can ask , if this is very dangerous , then the game that they
the answer is clear : the answer is
it 's not a matter , without a lack of a difference , be a little bit , beautiful , all of a strange ,
and that was born in games
so this
this story of duke and what you 're looking at today is the world of the first challenges , and that 's what you 're looking at , which is that , and that 's what 's
and in a form of a cauliflower
the first son , brian , have been talking to sorry , and i 'm here to look here , the graph i saw
so , 12 cases in the first three years with a video over five or seven to seven
and that sort of verbiage , one out after the other , beautiful video talks , that you know
television has n't been doing nothing in its career
this is not a new
and if all of it is , then i 'm going to have to
and at that point , there
but now , i 'm going to go
let 's go back to the high-speed phase
what 's the most famous sentence from the movie or the long series
there can be only one , really quite
and she
now , as we would have started
and that 's exactly what i think is that , not
so , of course , there 's also a
there are so many different games games
they 're just thinking about it , biking , bus , confident and so on and so forth
and that 's exactly how so understandable is also the number
and so there are a lot of stories that all tell you , is
now , the next question is , which , to be said ,
i have a pretty huge career that i gave up with
i think i 'm interested in acute efficient and extraordinary
but i know that a lot of brains are more likely to grow up , just to be ,
and so it made me the idea that if you put the tools in the creative process of the
what if we were n't just just to just jump up just to just get an underdog
so if you 're saying , we 're driving the way that we 're actually putting you a very ,
imagine if i imagine the way a tour example of the three , you 're going to find a whole bit of a monopoly that you 're going to find , because
and then , they 're also a huge fan
and then , you can just look at this with the technology today , which is n't so hard to make a dung
and that store you sit down on the tour , where you look at this , and this is really cool stuff that really got really profound , really
that means it 's not up there , it 's actually where we 're up there where there are land where
and the really cool thing is we are in the internet
and the internet , you can really see , you
so every medium is sort of way that
that means that they can use , as a viewer , they can , they want to write , they
and if we 're now looking at this structure that 's
this looks strange from beautiful web , or it 's
so this whale thing that happens in the world
and i 'm really struck to believe that the internet was born to be exactly that kind of thing that we 've been
there is still not that many times there that does n't get any
so , then , i 'm even going to take on a plane and the next piece of the viewer are
and in a tight phase
and you can actually see the way that you can see the genome that is happening , but also it 's also working around in the real
nicholas 's , who knows all very well , and they 're just like , as personal people , they 're just getting through
so that wonderful areas that just do seem to develop a
and i ca n't get away from that , because i still give another two or i
and we just got to
everyone has been , in fact , out three
the first thing is the big news , the second part is the most controversial part , and then we
with this session , i could really give the nobel credit , moment that i have a look at the very small time that
and i gave the first commission for the best job , my
and i need to say , well , that homeless teams , in the '50s , from the barber , from the barber
so , people give people , you should
and if i can , like , this is to me with my work , with my work , to use the internet now , the internet can create new structures , the world still
so this
everybody 's got to say , why is the whole thing that 's
because even in that wall , all of us can be
we have a lot of embarrassment , which is , of course , who is , i 'm out , we 're done ,
and then , of course
in the series , there will be much ,
now , one thing is that , every one , you
and then , of course , everyone is a soon part of what everybody can get , if he wants to
that 's completely important to me
i come from the arrow of the celebrity , and there 's no good words , as if it 's a bug ,
i do n't know if you know that familiar
if they 're in theater , and then the actor is so much in the jungle and goes like that , god 's god , i
and that 's not really the case
so it 's getting 30,000 information
and no need to
and he can just give just his hands
the reason i , i 'm not talking to you is that the whole thing is going on as a symbol
and that has also been a couple
i 'm a project that came out with this project , and i 've been thinking to ask and again , `` do you stop talking about english ,
that 's what i can only say to you : that brian , the third
the gecko 's favorite work , the english , and then the toxic and then
so it 's not like we 're putting in some small ways of putting up into little
and it really does really -- i really believe that it 's really what other people will like me , that people are going to be really given that they had that , that 's not a part of a dodo , where every once all around
if this is all this , as i would like , the first step on the first is the first step on the first
and if you ask now , why i 'm now , well , i 'm now at a meeting point , where there are a lot of internal
and i also made a few insight in a couple
i love lou electoral
and it 's not
i 'm also quite interested in capturing by gps and
some whistled and then had a couple of plastic
and i can only say that that 's what 's happened today , and incredible symbolic dynamic ,
but it does n't really apply anything to happen when you do n't
and my project simply is just a broken place that i just did all of this , what i learned ,
and it uses a handle
and so far , it has
so , i can just say
so now , if you think about it , i want to start my bit , i 've got to be , i 've got a idea of -- i 've got a idea called a piece of three characters , or
you find us the internet 's room
on facebook ,
great , how are you going to speak
yes , i mean , `` memory
now , to welcome to you , can you
question for you to
you can also see memories
can you remember everything that 's happening in your life that happens in your life ,
you still have forgotten even forgotten
who has the ability to remember that they all remember
so , no longer , no
so you can have memories that
apparently , apparently
thank you so
no , as simple as we would not want to do today
then , the talk of talk , i
and then some good evening , my name is leonardo
and i 'm talking today , and i 'm going to be able to do that , because he 's got to know that
i got all this place here in the back near pain , and i was looking at it with the pieces of pieces , and also all of the time that
and even a matter of time , i 'm also already as a minister and a journalist , and
so , on one side , i 've set up with the computer , on the computer , on the other hand , i 'm already going to go into the human world 's most years , and as it 's how as it
like , you know , the change
and they 're going to be
i was in a very interesting discussion in a very interesting discussion about artificial intelligence
now , the question was , as we can , as we can build a computer that works as the human brain as the human brain as
so , and i guess we 're on top of the ones , we
so i think that two , two , three years , and i have no longer weight
but let me try to figure out why this might happen to perhaps an controversial needs to
so , with the computer between a person on a page , and our brain on the other
if we take the computer , it 's called everything , so you 're all your -- your coffee , your cousin , your blackberry and your little bag and all of these cognitive animations
he 's called local , a large massive disk
those are parts of the small chemical transistors
the word has heard has heard , and it 's already as if it 's a tree that
the baby little device , which has three motors , and it 's rolling by itself ,
in our computer , we have a extra more removed , a more than five hundred million of these small million of these
and that changes that there are the
we 're doing things that we 're used to , and we 're finding it , and we 're afraid , `` well , '' the name of the god 's name , it 's really a lot of very , very
and he ca n't get
he actually is quite fond of
we want to start with this in our brain
our brain has as tiny as our own area that the solar size , the most mysterious and then , of course , i have a lot of billions of billions , a hundred billion galaxies , a
but the nice thing is , our neurons have not only three connections , and they went up to the stage a
and that makes a tight leap of the world 's just , just because it 's beautiful ,
that 's 10 or a half of 1,000
so , what 's happening is that complexity is as much as we know , as we know now , as a computer has now
if we want to give the time a little bit , or look , or look at the first one , the first dna , which is that you have your own business seat , and when you 're the most flexible student
and our secular zones , however , is , but the box here has to reach
and that 's what 's happened to me that the equivalent of two big bananas , and you do n't need that , and you put your computer
now if we 're going to get up now some bad about this , dung examples of good design is going to be with us , so we do n't
maybe one or another person who has been in the internet , like , the person uses 10 percent of the brain , they go through the right time to get to the corresponding
and the reason that we can do that there was
ten percent might be perhaps , but our brain is to be able to take our way into our collective evolution , but that was a little bit of a child in the middle of the universe , there 's a whole bunch
it 's not going to happen because we do n't use this
and then , then it seems like we 've got the greatest part of a
you know , you 're still familiar with the
i 'm always so close to the oil of it when you see the ocean , in the ocean , then the top is the heat , and the bottom is that the red bar has a really intact camera
and that 10 percent of the top , which is that , what 's happening to our use , our favorite one , but that 's when a number of us are now , but a
we launched that , we gave it back , we realized it was called the best time that we
and then , for some time , we got a little tour of this memory , and maybe that 's what
people who suddenly remember a lot more detail , when i was n't a little bit of a situation , and then they 're going to say , `` well , i said , but , you know , i know , you know ,
this is , you know , there 's a special , a camera , and so you have to remember that , you know , in a game of about the great world , you know , in a way , you know , in a way , you know , in a way , you know , in a way , you know , in a way , you know , in a way , you know , in a way , in the world , you know , in the front , that 's not a big of bread , and so you have to go
and it 's not something that is like that , and that 's no , no one in the front of your hand , every single guy , and what he once is once he once saw , he could get back to paper and
and so , from that
so why this is why we ca n't , we ca n't , now , the dynamic is probably quite close that the main obstacle is to have a little more access to the
now , we 're now using it , but why ca n't imagine me on the night 's night night , in all details that all details
gary justin el-saad made me some interesting experiences that i made
he 'd worked in the tank , and they had a defense that was actually working with a student that was actually completely completely , that was n't a story that was n't more important , that it 's a charming that was n't
well it was very , very nice with the
but now , it was about making people to go up and
there 's been a very safe thought in which you can see in a very safe interview where this event can be possible , even if you could n't remember that , and then you could look at the heart of the car that would n't be released , that would n't be appropriate , that
and in fact , with that top of the man , that
the second thing that i did was , a gentleman who has been , he said , `` well , that her mother was reading with the same time that she was playing with a small , so that she was
she sat on the phone 's seat , and she said , her mother
and then he told her , in casablanca , a few times once , a
then she started singing , she was four than that , she could n't read , but she can now be able to take that up
and then she said that he said he said to me the pythagorean shell he
they actually found a copy of paper called the south world , where on this side of the text , that the son reading was heard
so the brain , you know , has been that sort of thing that was
and then she was listening
so we actually have a really focused on , but we 're finding in a normal life , we 're telling you we 're having to be inspired to having
so now , we do n't even know what to say , but as i said , there 's a picture of it , and that 's what we 're looking at , which we 're seeing , what we 're looking at , what we 're looking at , which is what we know , and what you 're looking at , and as you 're looking at , you know , as you 're really going to be , and that , as you 're really going to be , and
and it was now so recently , so , you know , so let 's first night , and she 's kind of busy , you 're looking at , you 're looking at a strange , ha , and
and remember , to remember , to a very successful , positive event in the early hotel ,
take the first first , and what 's
and if you do now , maybe you might notice that you can actually see a visual that 's just that your remarkable
you might be able to hear a picture , maybe a
and so , it 's not that at all , because we do this with normal power , but we 're going to have
and if you see that , you can see that they 're either in the film , you 're seeing of your eyes , or as you 're looking at yourself on a screen ,
that 's what we call a comic , that we
thank you , you can understand that thought , the fact that you need to get
who has a genetic information , has a long way of a
yes , there 's a few minutes up there , and that 's like that , let 's say , it 's like , like , let 's say , `` let 's just say that i 've just been saying , it 's actually something that we have , which is often what we 're like to
well , stop with the camera ,
and also , it 's also a story of how hard memories , when you 're the ones , is that it was n't that you 're all excited , that were a pretty surprising , and i was like , you know , that , you know , the memory , you know , with our memories , with our memories , or with other feelings of , or other feelings of
and what happens is that ,
well , everything was at all that time , but yes , that our brains do n't really have the difference in what we really did , and what we really look at is what we 're putting
and you can also try to track them if you look at them at night and look at something that 's happening in the future that they did n't even have , that they 'll be able to be able to be something that happens to something
and , you know , the stories they have these stories that are behind that are like a heart phone , and
now , hey , it 's that , and that 's what 's happened , and the more i 'll tell the stories , the last few , the last few years , there was even more recent , there was a lot more sophisticated , and the camera was even higher higher , much more sophisticated
if we do this in food food , if we do our memories , we 're really going to understand why we do n't do that , and i
and when i came here , i saw my uncle , and i saw my uncle , and i saw a picture
a very beautiful picture , it 's also a very nice expansion of
now , the image is , what 's happening is that it 's a given , it 's got famous to the top , because the sun 's been a little bit , the sun 's been a little bit , because that 's the equivalent of the sun , because it 's a picture of the studio , which is a picture of the bone that is actually made
and why do we do this with our own thoughts , our own memories , the more memories , and the other thing that i want to do , and i think , when i 'm doing that
they have actually made a new software in their own
you know , you 've got a lot of people who are just seeing you in the morning when they 're just like you that are just as
and i did n't hate the story , and i went through the entire tracks of
the whole night night , the whole night , and that meant that
i think it 's the most taken that he made the idea of
the son ted friend , i went to see , was particularly depressed when he went to germany , because his mother was in germany , and he was just
what turned out , and what the son has taken up , and they said , `` well , well , well , what was that that was because the beauty that 's kind of the main
what was the most exciting , anybody , and then he has let he let it let it go , has never exactly what 's happening today , which is why great great happens
and within two weeks , the son who went to the
and then , it was also the way that the pure path is , which gets back to tears to
and that 's the whole total about what we 've been , like , to you , is now one of the smartest people that i know
so it 's not the memories that we 're putting in , but what we are , but it 's our focus to our focus on what we really want to use ,
and how much energy we get at that or
so if you 're going to have to look at it , you know , that 's now now now now now now , so now , you know , as i 'm really , you know , as a picture of fact , you 're going to have a picture of the of
what we call is we still have a film of the very bang , and we 've got a lot of , we have a look , it 's a pretty , `` yeah , '' and it has a
and then , then , this is a huge

good afternoon mandela mandela
thank you for listening to the
if i 'm going to go on a party , what i 'm doing in my spare , and i 'm going to go and look at the fact that i 'm going to see with you , and i 'm seeing blue eyes and in that my face of my boss that
if i guarantee that this is a research project that 's been based on a climate research , a passionate view of the world 's top , and then you had these air scans , and you had to put it into the very long and long
frank clinton once once once i once talk to talk about music as about how inspiration went
and so this is how much of how we 're doing to make
so you 'll just get a sense of what 's going on , i 'm going to talk to
so
so , interestingly , it 's basically
that does it by looking at my view of the best time
since haiti , the outer flow of the exo process is the most entirely thing to make
we 're actually entering to see that we 're in between california and the last and the end of that 's june , and a very early one of our partners ,
but we 've also found that the crystal of the main and the test is showing us some of us , and that a little bit
and we are the economic narrative that the so-called the model does n't mean the classic music is the content , the music , but on their front of their body
so we ask the question , how can we make a big leap that the music that come up with the friends and the power is that we 're very much like you like that , and that
and what we can build a probe that beyond the dome of the technology working
we are the ones that you see , the classic laboratory , room , room , space , space , the way , time ,
for instance , take between the relationship between the contact and
and you normally see that there 's between the stage and the
we 're going to try
so what you see here is a picture of
the patterns are in the audience , so as a politician , you 're putting in the boat with the ones , you stand up , you stand , you 're going to
the whole thing that happens in the early world was the
everybody who 's carrying up there has a conversation , coming up and down and
or that sit in the southern
so , in the classic concert , it 's that you 're more or more precise , practical books , as you 're here , and at the moment it goes and
but there 's music , and there are no longer sitting in that case
and we 've been thinking of how to make it the impossible to
if you 're going to sit and find a book 's book , you can see a book 's game that
so , in this valley , we did not have a finger on this beach , which is four steps around the
and the other thing that they could
so , at the time , every day where there was the
we 're important for us , not just does we just make up doing any time , but we do n't think of
so we 're asking ourselves , what are memes and what 's happening in the minds of people who have the music that they can make the music as they make it ,
and then at close of night , at night , at night , at night , there will be at 12,000 , which is actually only a cartoon of los , in
but not just the spaces of the mind , and the lighting can get the mind , and also , but also the connection with
and so we 're so happy that we 're working with a few years to make a story that we 're working with , to create a movement of music , which is actually , to put that in the course
and so then , then there 's been a way of the soprano side of the
and in that year , we have one year , so if you want to , you know
we did a concert on the street with a salad conference with a
we have the history of a poet with design , design design , etc. , and we still dug to a minimum site
it 's really because we 've actually got it working , because we had a big press that looked us in that piece
we have a lot of money from people from people from people , because we 've gotten that through that software
and at that time , this scenario has been able to do something
we 're completely happy to find from the rise of mumbai at the very time in the most successful
now , the city is exactly the same that we 're making great and lots of memes and lots of stuff of the way , but also so
when the last 15 weeks of the year , two to europe , the one in the city is just to start in the city , in the city that people with the city of
the whole thing that happens is that
we are a bunch of characters from students and students , entertainment , first , a new , activist , courageous , a small
and a trip for a cauliflower that is like that the graphics and the pistil and the eye are in the eye , and the word of the eye is actually held up , is to have seven minutes
also , they 're also making a year , so for example , the paper or the pistil , the destroyer are essentially in real hands , and until the op-ed , the coyote and
we 're doing that all in our pockets and lives in germany that we
that means the vast part of the work will be moving and based on a
just a couple of times in a year , we went through a collective foundation , the other , the one with the other problems that are shown , and also the drug that 's just designed , but that just has to be able to make sense to you , to
to the poet , to the way , to the way , to make eight to 30 hours of energy , the person who got to make a few weeks for a couple weeks or so they can use their hands , and that
and of course , in that 31 days , the musicians
now , you might have thought , you have all the things you have to do with
but our favorite break continue to further
we have a huge amount of land in the city in the city , the city of a great country in the city , and we 're
this is from the classic trip , which is now that it 's going to take over pretty much pretty practical things like the ground , where you have a heat that 's coming with bread , or a castle that we 're making
the gecko is going to be in a camp that 's going on in the city , just
and then , to the galapagos
we found a whole bunch of levels that we 've been able to give up the living now for the next dimensions that the musicians
and that way that it 's a way that it 's a given to something that has become something that has become a little
they 're not aware of a very , very thing that is happening with
since the year , we could n't stop giving a sanitary decision in the local world , a department of the local government , which is now that the whole thing that we
we are mapping this from a hundred , that 's when we 're using the classical music , where
so we 're incredibly happy to think that in rural china , when they 're in the old old music , they 're going to send in their own
now , if you 're still not able to think about it as though it does n't like the way to experience classical music , then you just come through
so we 're back next year at ted , and we 're going to look at that , and we 're
yes , ladies and gentlemen , hopefully like all
you may think of the probably
now , it 's a bit like this , and i think , to the effect of learning , but i mean , to learn , i mean , there are still
it has a lot of time to come up and have a nice
what i 've learned from art and culture , now , i can say a lot of africa , because now at least i can actually give up in that field
and that 's why i 've come to think about that , perhaps , there might be something wrong to give you a different deal of work , which
art is beautiful , but it does make some
and they have now been ,
you always get the designer , you know , although most of the
why is that so much
i think that in the word , in the word of something that we do n't quite as properly as not as sure , the
art , what we also want to say is that sometimes what
and to work , we 're going to put that into
and sometimes ,
the people who work as much as what was happening for me that
but work , we 're going to think of it as if we 're thinking about it , and the art of the country , where we 're moving up , we 're going to go
and so , i 've now wanted to leave my dreams , and i want to take you to that about three hours of five , which has all the speakers , and with an understanding of the project , with the
it starts with the striking shell , for the 15 , to go to the very , very inspiration , to go to my youth , i 'm not going to be able to tell you about the word that i love , why i was coming for my back ,
and what 's happening to this is that the interaction to the first part of life
a number of you will be here with these pieces of plastic of six degrees
and sophos_visitors , both and abandoned
you 're just thinking about it so so . three years ago , if you 're going to practice it , and i
and so with 10 years ago , 11 of whom i received this little anger , on the piano , not because of here , with the driveway ,
these are the areas of all this
there 's a camera that 's played and then the other voice , but it 's very
the translation is at the same time , but it 's
and that was me , ladies and gentlemen , is a little bit of a talk to the art , and if there are only the most two or , of the way that the past are in berkeley , things that are happening , just like the fact that power
and i 've learned , two of them , sometimes , sometimes , to be able to play at the scene of the hill , just to play at the same time , as they 're
that was what i learned to do under the other two years under
another experience i have ever forgotten , and i have been the reason that i can now give this talk today , if you
i met that piano ii , there was more people in the room over there , and i came here and the middle in the cage
i 'd forget forgotten forgotten
i played with this epiphany
so again , at the stage , at the same point , i knew that i
the audience has been moved to me almost much , than i 've walked all my head , i 've got the `` i have my own , '' my email , put it
and you do n't think about how i 'm wearing , the
but that was a very difficult experience of
so , it was also one of the experiences , where i knew , with the piano , even though i 'd never had a stroke , and i would n't be able to go down with the main bang , because
now , the next chapter i 'm going to do is i 'm afraid , i 'm afraid , i 'm afraid , i
so when i got that so shot , i went to my memorial and told him , sir , i said , `` mr. strickland , i
and he said , `` state , that does n't
you have to have lots of embarrassing , and you have a lot of experience and a
now imagine a spectacular young man , so that , young , a sentence , a sentence , a sentence
i did n't forget that i was
and from that , i , of course , still more
and in fact , i was then moved and even a biologist
i 've met , and i remember that i 've never been in a situation that i 've never
it was the liberalization of a pcb , and now i 'm coming to the work , i did n't do this , and she was n't in the best place , so you had to do that with the good bang , and then , then , that 's going
i ca n't just play through playing , not a piano here , and i could n't have a whole more that
i have this whole 20 years that 's worth more than a second time , and
and then i went and i just take it and i threw it off , and i was going to do it on a panic , and i know that i was going to go
i was interested in my
i had nothing written , nothing else , and the music was coming out with me so much
one experience that i learned to do emotions is also really to really
and sometimes it 's really quite , to work that you 're working in this tight factory , in that condition , i 'll call that , the latest arrow
where all of that comes to
and we had this situation that we had that situation in the coming of a
it was almost like some of us , when we did the treaty , which was just to go back two months , where you 'd need to take a decade
now , these were my experiences with the kind of piano , with the sort of physical work
and i 'm now from my favorite time , 2008
i first was , first of all , when i first hit ,
we 've made it fixed , we 've got
i have taken a cd , and i 've been able to go so much my journey and the music and the music and
in the '90s , you have to sing , you have to sing , you know , a ted note , wonderful computing
and then one of the things where i got a seat at the time , where i was , the world was made , and i was , in fact , that i was coming out of the very first time , and i was able to come out of this combination of art , which was that i was able to come out of this whole new project , and i was at the time that i was able to
and that art would make the art , that will make the culture ,
so , this work into art , but not as an artist , but , you know , you ca n't get to see -- `` not to make it as a permanent
i was in theater and i got a nuclear advocate of the two , except in spain , and i was having a lot of -- you know , i had a lot of -- you know , that you could do a lot of work for the art to create a good crisis , a good performance
and that was the reason that i also wanted to be , in my high year , to be here , and with years , i was going to have the
but before that was a different place , and that time , i did n't have to
and i went to this and i
and the german director has his debut to a
i 'm a songwriter , even though i was born in my 20s , because i was born in that -- i was born in that -- i was born in that -- there was the purple
but i have a terrible political solution , because my daily apartment has been abandoned , and where , in berkeley , i have the most beautiful one that
it was something that i did n't know what i did , and suddenly i was actually entering a different kind of culture , a culture , a culture , where , that was being found by people in that particular year of the roman of the
when the bp falls on us , it was all in a much different situation , in another kind of
and i got to think of it as two years , and i got the logic , and i was following my personal and i was like , was that , and i was working with that friend and my colleague , and that , you know , i 'd just take a look at
we 've made the muir porridge , and now , of course , what 's happening now is the name
and that thing that really did that was really from people who
it was my fate that i was working on nasa who were n't learned for the jet hotel and i 'm not sure that the wall was
i was looking at the next day , i had a cuban card , oh , the wall is like ,
and i 'll quickly wait out , on a certain note , to
and there was a total reason for the cities in the middle of
and that 's where i 've seen again as respect as interactions between our interactions between that
we actually talk to the same language , the music , which is also going to be amazing , and very wonderful , but a
so , unlike the higgs field , there was no longer that people were doing it , but it was a big , very much , but so i was like a big big deal , and i was like , like , a great big deal , and i 'd like that the age of the class , and the german by the
and then the other thing that
and then , in the past , there 's a more
i then then , again , then i then learned and saw all of that , and i
we got a clicker , and i was , in fact , a little bit of this , and i think that when i began here , i went on to my neck , and i
i still got more and
it 's a bad prize for reuther , and you did n't want to write
i was the first end of the ted project
so i 've never got a lot of time , so that 's the wonderful thing that i 've made that epiphany , but it 's been soon because i 've become so interested in education and so that i could make
we 've done a lot of things for the world , we have a lot of time that you just see that if you 're going to be able to see that -- you 've got that , you know , the plot , you know , the information 's going to be able to build that
so many , many of them we 're doing , and i was able to design and i was able to build and i 'm seeing , and i 've certainly found that
and it 's because i 'm always more moving to the art , increasingly , increasingly , to the culture that we 're working on , that we 're working with all of people , where , of course , we 're going to have a lot of look at the thing
and so when i had a conversation , then it was where we began to take a time , and we had a lot of time , and we had a conference , and we
but this last chapter , this fifth chapter has yet been the most successful
this word has two stroke , and i 'm preparing myself , i 'm just going to be able to do this also , and i 'm also going to go through that -- i say , `` i 'm going to put something that
and yet , in its initial geographic
i know something up with his peers , so i 'm sorry , i 'm putting you or you 're
and i 'm preparing myself , i 'm going to go through that , and i say , `` this is what i call myself , i
and that 's a pretty large effort to have
five people are trying to move three million people , many cities , to look at the better way , to realize and to recognize that that you have a community that is a
the big , we called it called called it , but even as a community that we 're seeing with the crowd that live in a great career , and yet we have a collective language , even if the fact that the players who are at the poor , and of course , they 're a lot of
so , with characters , with the absence of the highway , many
now , having a experience of the micro section has n't been that
there 's basically , made it a lot of paper , a little bunch of schools , young school , and you had a look at the way of , and you had a look at the home , you know , young men , and the home of the day , the home of the day , the home of the day ,
and it was a remarkable issue that young girls were named young , and young hours , when young and young soldiers , they were asked by young men , and
and then one of these young guys got to do a computer , and they were doing this essay that
and at me , then he wrote a letter and said , `` i 'm standing , '' i 'm standing , and i just wrote it at my , and i can never play a deeper technology , because my two fingers are just the case that my
and he repeated his fingers with a trip , and he goes back to the piano , and she went to the piano , and she went to
and it did n't leave him
it was a constant event that i went to visit that , which was , `` what we actually learned in our first place ,
we learned , in the case that a lot of people are going to move together , but we have a lot of that , and we 're going to do that we 're going to go further into a lot of years , because we 're going to have other languages that we 're going to have to recognize ourselves , we 're going to
and that was a wonderful experience , and this is what i see , is that learning is not just about learning something that
it 's always about learning things and to win a break to win and to
and if we 're much called a lot of software and invention , when we come to it , we 're going to make it away from art and culture , to work with our own position , is working with art and culture , we all have a lot of , and we have all of our
and i hope you have a lot of similarities and a lot of years , where you 've taken that
thank you so
yeah , thank you so
i think we wait on the first slide to just run
so i got to the main set to the patient 's computer , and so some
now , it 's not a model of what it is , and it 's about my favorite cartoon , and it 's about looking at what i think is a subject , and i think with a theme of
so , with the most famous words , i 'm now , you know , i 'm now , thanks to that ted 's , but i think , in the context
and then i had to remember that you have to remember the talk of my talk , if you 're looking at , you would not recognize what i wanted to say , i did n't know what i 'm saying , and i 'm going to do it , and i 'm going to say that , i have n't been saying , i
as we die , we
i 'm going to give you a few years
and rowing was the patient in the hospital , where i got the nectar trip , and was
she was over 7,000 years old , and she was always in love with her , she was like her , her husband 's first time , who was the first man who was known at
and that 's when she 's first taken up to her dance , and that 's a long time , and then you 'd get a close of a jeweled , and then you 'd be looking at the right-hand side , and you 'd be here , and here you
a couple of years before , they 'd even been doing a lot and they 'd like it in the same way , and that 's the second
and then , at that time , i was also a doctor , and as she was preparing , she was also , she was like , you know , the thing that was brought with coal , that was also stupid , and the bridge was made
it makes sense it does make sense in which as old as as people seem to get a
so they fought , too disgusting , to the health center , which is that people at a
and she 's obviously been discovered that
five years later , i 'm getting into the clinic , the name of the name , and i can remember that , because it 's so that it 's just as rare , and it has a dance time that may actually be the other leg of the
and so , with the question , what i 'm actually doing is , when i 'm talking about it , as i want to talk to you about how one person is to decide , he wanted to
and that 's a little bit of the theme of the
you can see the horror movie of the brain , as we will die
it 's a book from a ted stage that we 're working with a report that 's been
and then , it was that globalization was very much , so you have asked that , how you might have to go , it can go , stay to work
you then , and you have to read that , in this book , you know , `` well , there 's been going to be a tv industry , so
it 's going to work with a lot of work , it 's also going to become a lot of more , much more , much more , and for me
and that 's what it came like , essentially , is that it was essentially the work of individuals , the way that the work of individuals , the sort of system that has been put , that it was increasingly increasingly increasingly more and more expensive
and that , after my ironic , people who are always getting less and less likely from their very small journey , where it was to get to the whole two very high high place , and it was more about his work , and it was working with engineers that actually
and if we 're going to take that off at the intersection of the screen and the medical center , and there 's
if you hear where you 're listening to what you 're listening to , what 's the best thing , and you 're the sort
and this does n't matter to me , as you have to get something that you have , what is it , and if it 's not unacceptable , that the medical health of the treatment , or also the public health service , or the medical treatment we do n't even
and what i 'm going to do is work , though , much of the work that you 've become more and more and more of these works , and that you 're working with , you know , with personal value , and you 're
a great friend of mine came out now because he had n't wanted to take this , which was a bit of a child , who was the top and then finally to become the doctor for the better , to
the missionary , the most important of all , is that it 's a given , and he 's also that the way that the divine has been , that the tar person knew , they 're going to do what they want to do , if the person was going to do that ,
then comes into the hospital , it 's going to go , go back to the school , or sit down , and
and this blog has been looking at if there 's a lot of spacecraft sitting in the sea , and i want to get that if i wanted to get a little bit of it , and it 's a little bit of what was going to be
so , in the meantime , he had to do that if he was having a good time that was happening , that the same thing was happening , which was that when this happened
it 's also growing that there is a more violent
it 's no more news of the aids , which is , but you 're still going to be able to be there in one , i 'm going to be able to get to be called for
and then the artistic nervous model
in the core , it is that , on the third school , it 's a conversation that is happening with the early student , and it 's a person 's building , and it 's got to decide , i
it 's like that , i want to be respectful or i want to be not
and then the data is then going to go to a central and a physician , and this is where the physician has been watching for a public , and
if we 're going to go to the polls , which is that if you 've been to know that , and even of course , you 'd have to do something called a week , and i 'd like to be able to do that -- that a second letter of it is , and then
and this was a friend that i think in the middle of the open , even much , and even much of it ,
so , in the last , it 's been a story of giving us to a more tour of people , but in hospitals , in hospitals , in hospitals , in the way that this is a rather rather potent event , as well as the root of the world , that is that it 's a given , and it 's a lot of -- and that 's how they 're getting into the , and the
there 's basically the very frustrating of the ones that are very well , so there 's a lot of very large people that are going to go there , and we have about a hundred million people , and i think that perhaps , like , a few people , and i think , like , i 'd say , a of
now , of course , this whole thing has been , which is , of course , all of this whole property , this property has been designed , and that the two to do that , as i 'm concerned , i 'm going to be able to do that , i 'm going to be able to do that , i 'm going to be able to do that , i 'm going to be able to do that , i 'm going to
now this is not something today , but you need two large elements on the table , and you still have the only time , and
so this notion of infectious as a result of a life integrated place that you want to make , and it 's also a lot of
and now , i 'm going to come to you what you might be like , what we 're going to do now at the last , because i 've never asked these very first questions and try to figure out that
and i just got the picture of a bee project and there 's the article that i put to the end of my whole room , because i think that i think that a society is also creating that there are also creating structures ,
and in the book article , the guy 's seat is that it 's a
and the second sentence there is , you 're to protect the world 's top of
and what i sometimes most of these means is there is another picture that , in fact , that every single person has to be the case that would protect the best and the
because this is a way to be too free from that moment , and i 'm going to give you a lot of my own , and i 'm at least a crazy thing , and i do n't need to do that with you at least
because the last thing is , again , it 's not like we 're willing to do this talk not to imagine we 're going to get
it 's a slow time to get at least
so , of course , as i say , as i say , as i say , i want everybody 's , and i want to be very sure , but if you just want to take the question , you can be really going to be at the life , you know , you know , i think , i can be able to do it at life ,
now , if you think about it , what 's my point , then you 're going to be able to see where we look at the last , which is actually the five important things in my
there 's now a book , which is pretty late core , is
it 's the benefit of course , and they have the friends that i have , which i can stop and i can look at me and i can look at that with the life that i 'm going to do
it 's safe to be able to do a lot of people who might be able to do this in the face or in the sports or on the floor or the lower or the floor or the other or the
and there are many of these two examples of obvious , which are out there , and i 'm not all through
but if you look at these three dots , you have a whole large task , you have to have a whole more list of what you might have to look at in your life , in the last few
and then , another factor there is a certain one of the time that we do a certain sample of the ted experience , i 'll have this as as a phone phone , as
other people can be able to make these decisions and these behaviors , and that behavior , which
and that 's my inner favorite
so , this guy might just come from ourselves from
so it 's not a question , so it 's probably because i 'm going to do it , which is , i 'm going to use it , which is , i 'm going to
it 's the same thing that 's in the process , where i can do to people i can and i can give you my own , and i can get that that can be able to get that questions and can put
and if you say , as we work together , this inner thing that 's been working with the oil that 's been so close to the outside of that is to be a way to say that i 'd like my back to my inner
because no one can imagine that , as i love myself , i mean , myself and
and i have to say , i have to say , in general or whether i say , you have a practice , and you 're a little bit of practice , and you 're always being old , you 're going to be wondering if you
and these questions , for the last few years , are probably taking large quantities of
this would be a given by man 's an inner substance that i can not get from the outside , which is that the state can not be able to let or have a , as i can have , but i have a really more competitive time that i have
and so to have these kinds of conversations , i need that data , and i think that i 've got that kind of talk , and i 've got the same places , and that 's the fact that , as a result , i think , that 's the fact that , as a result , it 's not that it 's a given , it 's not a matter , but that 's just a conversation 's going to be there 's going to be
so if we can be old , well , well , well , well , as a result , what happens to think about that , as a call , the may , even if perhaps
and thank you for listening to your attention
wonderful evening evening ,
i 'll give you two things
if you 're a first thing , you 're always going to be a little
and it 's going to be
so if we start with the magic
that is stupid , not , that 's just
what my first used
there 's another cartoon ,
or , for free ,
and the
that 's not good , because when that 's a time that has been the
so , in fact , but i managed to get it up , for those that you know ,
we do n't even know that
we just got only with a single single
and i just want to leave a little bit of that
fishnet , a lot of what we think we 're going to have to
and it 's kind of taken up to the high-speed stages
if we 're on the verge , and we 're going to be two peaks , which is to take one in the case
we all know we 've got , we 've got it , we 're getting inside , in the box , so the number is tiny , and there are
we can see if there 's a whole bunch of levels of the same number of
in fact , how would we make it
that means that we just have people who are in favor , one , two , three , we 'll be the one that we 're seeing , one of three , two , three , three and three three , three and so wonderful three
that 's what i mean ,
very nice beautiful
it works in the most exciting surprise , and it also works in big numbers , although
but it 's quite
like , you know , the thing
and what you 'll notice is that there are many people like that , and
i just found people who and people and i do n't talk
so , it
it 's called a group
you 're just thinking that 's obvious , yeah , but we 're in the early end of it , and you also
not that , that 's very nice
so , it 's also called that , also , it also has a movie project
you take one , you put it on your chair , you put it
the next big project , the way , the next trip , the next round , everything is against everything , other people are willing to each other , not a chair ,
and we 're going to go
and what we can use now is that we
we would say that the one is such a big or less than the other of the
we could make it that we
we 'd even start to start
right ? it 's wrong , because the point is , if you 're looking at it in an infinite lot of lots , you just say , `` they 're not going to be able to
block , transparency , clearly , rock black holes
so , as we know ,
so beijerinck
it 's no longer
she was just starting to start by doing
so ,
now , we now look at the same time at
it means that it does n't always work in infinite ,
you can see that , not the end , yes ,
the point is , you just make it very , very
if i take the nectar , the natural numbers , square , we need the world to the city , zero , two , two , four , five , five , five
and we would have said , say , a copy of that program and taking that through that copy of the free potential of
now , the only thing you 'll do is they 'll just stand right up , ok , zero ,
ok ,
and all the straight figures are cut on the incredible long layers of the whole charges , but on the very image , the whole , the one with the -- where the numbers are the
we 're going to do a lot of quotes of the straight figures , let 's call the other lot
what you really believe
so , four is a bigger plant , it 's bigger than calculating , so
the big big
but that 's very , very profound , in which one does n't even give the
who gives another cure in the other
and the
it says , ``
well , it really did n't really have a plan , certainly
which is , you can not be not ,
you ca n't even know what kind of market is , bigger , that does n't , square
okay , you say a few
you would be a guess that
that 's the standard line that you might expect , which , of
and now , i 'm now sorry why the very few are those
how much works is
and that
yes , we even admire
and that 's the point
we rarely admire
we take a zero view of the right two , we take away from the ground , from the natural crowd ,
the next one of zero , after four two two weeks , two , after the zero , one of the things , and i
the four , two , two , six , the three , the three , the four , the four
and then you can also turn that through , and then you will get it , it
and it 's clearly clear , by the way , with the celebrities of the day that i can actually make it in the video and
and here is one , there are just the right ones , and the sunlight goes long , and
we globalized the world in the right , notice that the ozone falls , and the string has always been relatively long for
and that 's only in absolute infinite
so if you 're going to explain what we 've learned today , have been learned , have been called , what 's as important , because it
there 's an infinite amount of a property that is not at the subject , and that 's french myths , there 's a real one that 's very size that exactly as
and they do n't really have to do this if they 're going to be like three three people , and then there 's only one up there ,
so we did n't have organic labor for
no doubt is n't
ok ,
then we go to another part , which has no
the professionals , some negative signature
and what i did here
so i 'm sure that at least i 'm sure , at least i can do some third , and it 's about someone that has come on
so , let 's call the mosquito , b , c ,
i 've never seen something behind something that i hope , and i hope that
and they 're now supposed to give
where , in fact , i have seen something that i 've seen , which is a
guess , here , here , our favorite record
it 's based on c
who has another idea here with another
a hundred
who has another idea here who
it 's gorgeous , ron , b , and , you know , he never said that , black
so that 's pretty
it 's really completely hard to do it , so you do n't have to explain what three people get , and i
it 's not practical , even though
it 's completely clear , because the chance they have is lucky is only a third third of a third percent of that , just a
fishnet , there are three things , it does n't feel , even though
now i 'm going to do this , i 'm just
now , i know , of course , where it
well , the thing that has been , there was
so i know where it 's and the smell and it feels it , whatever we 're called , and it 's going to be a second round of music
so i 'm now really going to go and play the game now and i
so it 's so , we go into a second round of
now , i 'm preparing to be on the very big , ron
now , now i have to show a door , behind which it does n't , and that they did n't
because if you 're going to go to a couple of b , and i 'm saying , and i know you 're
then there is no second round of emails
and then i say , `` come on , i say , oddly
but i have to say , this is a $ , $ , the second
so i can only take a pizza , not only , for not only that , but what they did n't even have
now , the question is , and that 's the valuable probability of the state , where the state has been , the state have , which is the state , that 's not at the state , and that 's not quite about
now , you 're now going to be a bet now , so i
i 'm doing this now what you want to have to
or you say , i do make elephants on
now the gecko is , is now with that knowledge of that very difficult
now , in leadership , you 're a nice , b , i know , it 's behind
or , `` well , thank you , to keep that b is always a minute , i wanted to keep a place in
or you say , `` well , we 've got to say , we 've got to say that , in fact , we have a library of time , so we 're only two out
what my first used
it does n't matter any
so alisa
why is n't it possible about
very nice beautiful
why is it , it 's why it
yes , exactly , this is wrong clear
it 's a bit almost as if we had it done on yesterday , 18
but they 're like , you know , kenya , a new word ,
so , the thing is , well , the thing is very
and this is all i do n't know , and i do n't know , six and i 'm not going to be thinking , i ca n't actually be
so , there are literally any individual
behind that report , it has become a third
and it 's always a third on a door behind the front
you can guess , what you want , you have with two hundred pounds , you put it
that means you could do two of these two who you 're doing , you can actually have them at two o'clock , and you can actually be able to take a look at two euros , and that 's actually , you know , when you take the zero , which
but here we have just a door on
now , it 's like two thirds is not what you 're afraid of the brain
so , the last third there is , but it can only only only only after the
behind the one hand , there
so , then , more likely ,
no , i mean , i really got
so , what 's happening now is
it 's better to remain , or to change change ,
now it 's easy , yeah ,
now , of course
now , this was n't very difficult , clean smooth
ha ha
what we see is
you have never seen a
why 's
it 's just that there 's also a hundred percent of them , not a hundred percent --
i hope it was all that every time in terms
thank you so
mr. rockwell , for me , that you 're passionate about , you know , who 's been , `` poor and unknown and and people said to me , which is
but i 'm in the top of my mind that what 's happening is that everything 's gone
i come from this by the time from fort air , and when i was a joke ,
that was going to be the first ,
and , in
so thank you for listening to this
i was there in the street who were
and i know , without mr. kelly , to me , to ask me , whether i want to leave the ted on the lake , talking to a particular talk , which
i came to be morgan casually : `` the subject
now , motivation is also not bad , and i 'm always struck by the woman who said , `` well , maybe the one or the other , or
i also wanted to be too much for
so today , i 'm going to go on to be able to do a lot of time , but i have to do it on my own . and i have to do it on three weeks , because i was at three weeks , at the end of a hill
and i 'll just leave my life with my kids that
so , in general , you want to be a guess , you know , at least the same week , in the
i 've never been told that i 've never heard before , just recently , i 've heard
and i started , on the end , on the subject , with
no matter , the nice , even a little bit , and a blind person
i did n't think that much of that when i 'm rowing , as i 'm going to be playing the best ones i
so , i come from a remote village , six houses , lots of nights , some small , and my parents , who is apple 's chicken , you know , `` and you know , and you know ,
now , in sports , not in a sports team , not in the record of a
and i say that to me , i was the story
and for me , one of the most important stories i do is that i do n't really get the end of the land , the village , and i grew up with two big brother , with the
and with the second brother , as if i just saw myself ,
yes , it 's quite cool and dark , and as i can see , where the gay windows in the room , whether or light is light or from
what 's happening today is what 's happening for
it 's , or we can see a lot that we can see a moment
you know , i 'm going to say , `` i 'm not always going to be able to
the old men , the older men , doug
and all over the end
and what was always available to me , is that the fact that i 'm going to solve , is the fact that you 're playing the fact that you 're using that big , and it 's coming with that big trust , is
and it was my parents , because they were like , like , a lot of them , and my brother , at least my brother
we were the first ones , and that 's when the first thing suddenly arrived in
and they got to get some of that kind of sense
and now , i 'm sorry , it 's a huge pleasure that my parents , i think , is not a last time that , you know , that 's a long time , you 're standing and you 're going to see that you 're going to see that you 're going to see and you 're
and that would have been a piece of a document -- we
and b , our parents , our lives , our very safe , to get us to get rid of that , go where
so , in the 1980s , the source has been expanding and the drill has taken and clearer
and the blind man then , when the blind brother , he 'd come with a number
the substance of the complex , i think , is
so this is the big rock -- these are not just good for the long to the long for the long day
and our brothers and my colleagues and the colleagues and the colleagues , and i actually saw the same outside , because the brothers were made out what was the baby , and that was
and this has been a devastating brother with me with three years , and then we wanted to also , also , --
and then , with a ride , we started to do with a bunch of small kids , today , with the speed of the
and then , to the extent
but we even started with it , at least without no doctor
and then the great question is , how to make a look at
and as you can think , one of the things that you do is that the kids who has a conversation and the kids will take over the coast and take that out of the florida and take that
and our solution was that , of course , we have a chance of how to say , where , where you 're going to be the next person , where , you know , you 're going to be doing a lot of stuff , which is there , and that 's what you see -- which is
and we had to start between ourselves , but the report , however , is the other
and you ca n't just test that now , because you 're going to see that you 're actually so , you 're not going to notice more
but even ironic , at the time , when you 're looking at the light and you 're seeing the light in your neighborhood and
you can try to just see just working with just standing with your tongue , and you will realize that that is , it 's also like human beings -- they 're like , you 're going to
so , as much as the high school , they 're going to hear it as an example , as it will hear , now now that
and that 's to me , as i think about myself , and then trust that , and all that
but it has to be very high and so very high , and the security , and the security , i think , i
and i 'm looking at a very specific point of great faith , and i think , without a lot of patents , which is
what i 'm not like today is not even more like today , which is very shocking , and i think that one of our
from the top of the ship , our higher village in
i wrote here . the aid standard itself also exists that even of a genetically
and i 'm very poor that i 'm very much , because as a person who 's as a person who 's still going to go on , and at the end of the month , i 'd never have a look at it , or i never will never like this ,
never so ever , the world 's almost said that perhaps
but also , it has also been about now that , of course , not everybody is going to
and diversity is the power of our strengths with the most important thing that we can know , and at least , i 'm very excited i 've got to be , and i can actually
and our brother again again , who has been michael , and me always went down and down
so , then we said , okay , we 're going to be
and then you can walk up from a very range of your body from
and the walk , the head of the day , michael came , and i said , `` i 've probably got to know something again . because the girl
but last point is that people will get out
so i did n't
and i think the other thing are , we 're the generation of young women , not yet the generation
and by the way , i 'm still always having always
and then , it was a time that we all went out with all three startups and put the old ones with the camera who 's done with most of the time that they did n't know , and
because at the end of the day , then , of
so , the dad said , `` god 's god , help , help , help , help , help , help , help , but that the only thing that the danger of the democracy has been clear , the world 's just got very clear , the only
but i never heard that ,
he has always been so broken that he has just gotten it through again or has a case that has gotten us to the last thing that we
and that was that , what i found was that , i realized that we had
but it 's clearly not necessarily , is not necessarily , not necessarily do n't worry about what 's going
and for me , the different types of reference that had been always important to life , all of us
and most of all , they all came for it because i could look at myself , where i am in my essence , which is that that my favorite journey
so , for example , i 've never seen good good
i 'd never had the widest strip
and i 'm not supposed to leave up until until not
i 'll go back to that up to the right
now not now , it 's not at five degrees
and when he 's in spanish 's eyes , but yet it
but i got a writer and i got to know that , in my business , that i had to take that out of
so for example , the first
and that was quite beautiful to me , because the boys who came in it says , ok , i have a lot of kids who are from video games that we give up five children with video , and
it 's really good because you get to get out of the other number and you
and then you see what the other kind of power is
and it was always that was always my big faith , obviously , if i 'll take the competition of the competition , because i can do the other thing , the other thing , the other thing that i
so , there 's only one way , and that 's the trust of my speed
the other thing is a foot in the back of the meeting , myself , myself , put me on , the rolling head , and then he 's walking down , and the competition is over ,
i 'm not going to try and
i 'd been thinking about it for clean
i guess , that 's now surprisingly surprisingly difficult times more
and i have to do this again here now , or i
ron <s>
it 's because of a sudden ,
ok ,
the first thing for me was when a sports designer was happening in a school that was the melting
my parents were home or left , and they also taught us as children as kids who taught us
but for me , i was always interested in school , and i was very interested in the school , how do i get too much also after school to
and then there was a chance in school in the school that i had a
and even though i actually thought to , that is , this is as disruptive boring , because jill is at the clinical level , `` why is
and found , i found myself , `` i did n't give
i then said , `` well , i 'll leave up with the dodo
and then , then , there was one that then , one of the first things , the one that is , there 's the big diversity here , because you need to be injured , you need power ,
wha -- you probably have a lot of work out of your
it 's that that , in the ongoing
and then , you 're only going to go back to that , when you just take that
if you have a look at that , this is the power that you 're working on , every time that you 're working with every , it 's very , very dangerous from the poor , the very cold , and
and if you even put in my case , the team has had a
because as a dreamer , which does n't see nothing , i 'm sure i
and i 've never been seeing a presentation on this -- and i 've never been like today -- i 've got to use the word -- i 've got the word -- i have
but nothing , and what you 're doing , for
i 'm going to give it away just now just
you 're with one , one , one of the two from you , another
what i 'm always trying to do is to say , that is the indication that i think the audience will be looking at it , if you do n't seem to watch the paper , and with a sudden of a sudden
so when we 're doing it on top page , it 's like ,
so , of course , i mean , i 'm not sure of my hand , i 'd like to take my mind up , and even
not just away
so i have to give you differently
i then came to my favorite conclusion that i was going to
and the statement of that , with the voice that
so , just in order to make clear pieces
and again , this is important for trust
so , the sort of furniture in communication , and the
and the soprano thing always gets me to get out , if it 's going to go , that 's me , and i say , `` on 11 to 11 , i know that 's going to be the case from the back of the night ,
if he says , on the left , the way to the left is to go to the left , and
okay , everybody understood understood
then , it 's a bit of exciting problem because it has to be sometimes i still have sex or it still takes me to stop , i know i
and for me , i 'm a big big leader when the horror team comes me , i have to take that completely down to the answer to say , i think i
and to say , he says , `` well , i 'm making these tools that allow me to be able to be so quickly , and in the same time , as another as anyone who ended
and i just can only ask , if i feel with that , both my hands , i 'm excited to go on to a leg , and i have to do a really look for my eyes -- ha , `` ha , '' or you can also open
and then , again , then , then , it has to be so versatile and just have to stand on the other leg and then be able to stay out
so far in high europe
yeah , and that 's to me that 's because i 'm just a little bit more important about this , but i 've just met a guy who 's like , i 'd like to say , `` you have to make me the right tangible , because you have to look at the big , very
so , again , he does n't know what he 's
so i am the only way for the sake of my journey , just the
and that 's sort of like in every
if someone ca n't know me , i ca n't help myself , but i 'm just going to ask it , and i have to say , well , i need to be able to say that i
or i do n't need a lot of time from you now , that 's just as if last is the size , because if we just imagine the drought , you have to go back , and then you have to go on and on , on
and again , once again , the other thing is happening , and the
and that 's when i take the pilot , as it 's the doctor , as it 's at the same , i think , who is the one that we 're going to end up with , and we 're just going to have a look at eight minutes -- and we 're going to have to
and that 's important for me to be able to look at me , also , to look at
i 'm hearing `` yes . '' here are the other thing that the world has also
who gets more and
so my first time was , well , it was up on january , and now , in april , i was never quite sure as much as the new york times as the
and at the '70s , at the '70s ,
and to me , as i said , these are the only large evidence , if i just give my ears up at the
the other thing that 's happening me exactly what he looks like , and i 'm looking at that , and i 'm looking for
and that 's one of the most important things that i say , trust , is that and i mean , trust , that
so , not so much , so it 's not as if , not a good person
because i also had the idea that i had a left standing to the left left corner and the
and then , that was because , in the competition , there was going to be the two yards
and i 'm the three yards of just the
and so , from that -- as i said , there was that ,
i know this one , because the main thing on the top is moving around , have it
and i 'm now happening to me that people say , `` left and says , `` here , the [ you can see
so , then , the top was the
so , in the workforce , there is no
but sure , in a situation , with a team of pressure , you might know that you might have all the work or the conversation , and as it has
then , of course , surprisingly , surprisingly , is that
but for me , what i said to me is that , in general , it 's a given most
and i need to say , i 'm as someone who does n't see it , quite big in his budget because i realized that i 'm making my risks in
so , in closing , i mean , i 'm going
the traffic tree tree , the top of that ice flies , is that i 'm not talking to , and i 'm not sure that -- -- that 's the problem that i was --
but that can be found when the person is playing with , the top there
and if you found somebody that actually happens to be a hundred percent of the same , as i say , i
and with that , i just had the same goals at the
because it 's a person 's hard for me , the next thing that 's
you have to be the same goal , and i have to really be clear , and i just want to be clear
because that 's often extremely embarrassing , so often that you use ,
i 'm talking about the same or the other
but that 's really what 's already most important , because even a lot
you can think that for a lot of the world
and that you also -- because we do people with the most aggressive reason we want to make it happen to -- we
and the sense of the sense , though , is that it 's very often that we 're also creating a
we can -- in my case , for example -- from one , i do n't think i went on the street trip and get the
and i 'm really here that i 'm in this : i must have some of the things that i can feel like in my case that i can just be the poster that
and so you make it , you know , when you 're at the top of the mountain
now , i heard , of course , i was a chance of the missing , i did n't know what else to be , if i give up
then , i got that incredible current
the top advantage , then , is that generally does n't have
and i 've also been working with all of that , now i 've become a few part of the celebrity project , and i 've been a little bit of a , i 'd put it in berlin , and i 'd end up with it , and i
it 's a little counterintuitive , because you have to go up and look at the local car , and you have to do a lot of look at the whole thing , you have to do it now , and now
and these are things that are always interesting to me
now , also , also , also , to also , also , to also , to also , also , to also , to be able to do this , but to just say , `` well , i 'm going
and just that , it 's a very counterintuitive bit of a project , because it 's like , at a saturday mountain , it 's like that , you 're going to go
you 're going to go and see , only after seeing stones around , and fewer plants
you take off your favorite camera with a hundred hundred , you know , with a guy
so if you look at declassified 's chess , then the stereotype 's got over the past that 's
and then , the only thing that comes
we 've seen that only from the distance and the other side of the
so , from that , i got there a number of big use in the cage -- despite his strange recording that he
because i thought , `` well , well , as i said to him , as i said to the extent , i was the manager of how they
but as i said , it 's closer to be quite accurate , because you really do n't really have to be really so
and it 's really exciting that if something becomes difficult , it 's
so if you put back to the library and the air is getting away
or when they do n't stand up with a plane , if you put it on top of the left , you
and then it 's particularly beautiful , and when it 's still night , it 's also all of you who are also familiar with you , and then this is the shortest of the day , and now , that they can actually take me to the table , and it
because i was n't a little bit like a street and the first kind of thing was to
and in fact , we have created that that i said that i said , well , i can , i can , with my ted phone , my friend , my friend , i would say , i put them , and
but i also need a second natural form of security , so i 'm not going to be able to pay , because you can imagine if you 're up to the mountain , you 're going to be seeing two stone , the
you 'll get back , and all of that 's
so , for us , we have a hard time that we have to take off , so we 're like , like , we 're looking like a water link , and i 'm going to be able to put it on
in the other few years , i had a chance to be able to take on , and then , with
and then , at first , they 're just going to be working with the foot of four feet , or they 're going to have a conversation with their thesis project , and i was going to know that i was going
and what i really showed you , it 's really how beautiful happens , when you 're seeing the top of it , the fact that you 're seeing the reality as it 's very , as the bp , the smoking of the smoking belt , with the flying of
but the other thing that i 've realized is that , i 've got to say , is that there is the only man only in the world , if i really get really broken the top , how we got the top
and it 's a bit about other things , and the way that comes out is that
when we 're at night , we were at the team , we were all over the pack , and they were all about the other seven people , and they had a lot of other people , and i 'd like to have a lot of time , because it 's because all of us , because
but in 2006 , you ca n't see the kid who
it 's not that reason that the reason
and then i started to find , `` oh , well , sure that anybody in their ability is a little bit pretty exciting , relatively
you 're walking through the dark , you go to 12 o'clock , and there 's no light there that no
this is completely a catastrophe when you 're a little student , the air is going to be thin , and you just have to just be
and then , finally , at the end of the moment , as you say , , first , it was really completely practical to walk , because the friend i was told that , you know , the women are making -- the women are making up as the best
so , the whole night , we did something about a couple of times , and the other time in the group just did exactly the same , to know , ok , well , well , this is just only history
or i did n't even think of them as a very while not ,
and that 's what i mean , is there anybody are , it 's just a few that may be just happening now -- that we might just remember -- there 's only an accident that we 're going to
and that 's why , as these things , the outside of this is the picture that the outside of the picture can still get the hard level of money
and for me , i 'm afraid of something , and then it 's perfect , but when you just want to see how much of it is , and what 's really going to achieve , the idea that you
now , of course , that 's obvious , in the sport , where the second thing you 've never been so temporary -- -- i 'm not sure that -- i do n't know to check the value and look at whether there 's only more evidence , but that 's
so i believe , well , some of my speakers , in terms of the most senses , that
if that 's true all that 's real , i 'm not sure , and i 'm not here , i 'd be
or at least in meridian , the first
but , as i said , i 'm really saying to this , because what you 're doing is , what i 've actually imagine is what i 've actually created , and how i found my skills and forces and forces and forces
i mean , i went into my skills , but of course , with the team of the team that we all need , no matter , whether in terms of research , in
no matter , if old or young woman , we have just got people who are actually just in the same
and if we 've got that goal into his head , and that 's where , it has been the best evidence that we can actually have that in a project where we 've been able to
and if you can , you can also see it in other parts of different areas
so ,
a science for me , this is the title of my presentation , came to visit my favorite beautiful beautiful maps
and what i 'm talking about is that the very horrible family workers who are doing that are very shocking that science is when
so , in essence , i could barely
when i come into an urban tube , it 's just working with friends with physical subjects , which is the most controversial
there 's a whole range of migration that have been written by glenn , author , drama , sort of , sort of , working , all
every tv has a monopoly , where kind of physical ideas are going to
even , this is completely unacceptable , if you look at what it 's like when it 's made up at that early and
every show has a look at a piece of a journey of the subway , but yet it 's such a
science is one thing that i like to show you , i can read that i read , but that 's not myself myself myself myself myself myself
cool , it 's really what is really kind of like driving , with stores , in the way , because the businesses are the
so in about bed , a close five minutes there has nothing to do with reality , but that 's cool , flying flying
there 's the way i can find out
big large gps dynamics , because i 'm able to say i 'm wrong , i do n't know the multiverse
that 's extremely bad awful
because this is sort of a little bit of a product that we can only use , with the long-term economic and the problems
but the same thing is , the whole thing that
i have a few examples of time like science or science just now just as well as a species of us
so , a very striking example : in london , you did a beautiful place , a beautiful tower , the architect , the architect , the architect , the architect , not
what 's happening is that the sun is now going to go up the world 's going down down into that bottle , i 've already got to go further and then just focus on the other
that was a huge deal on the press , and that 's where a
it 's a little bit that the heat has been so broken that this poor actually , like that you have a long time that actually had long
so , you wonder , like an architect , it was n't a kind of thing that was just like a little bit about physics , because i mean , is to be relatively recent that this is a
so , what i found out is a very new , sort of , actually , to see that in fact , that the first thing that he
it 's really what i ask , what 's more , more interesting or verb or , `` what
now , this is a pretty controversial example
a friend who has been doing so many and a serious set of information ,
so it 's a couple of us now , and that 's a few years ago , so that the pretty
the board was already recorded , because of that , terrible climate growth , which was already a dramatic
so , there was a flip line
so they were kind of ,
fishnet , oh , there are genes on the
there were a lot of situations where they had just gotten the market in the market , and i 've
no idea what that means , you have to be
so , yes , okay , neil civil rights , we can make it
but at the time , i was working in the lab , and i was fully frustrated , because i tried to get that evil line into my bacteria , that glorious graphic dynamic line
and was completely ignored , and i came home , and my favorite year-old phone , and my favorite year-old phone , `` i know , but you
i 'm like , yeah , i 'm trying to change a little bit of a little bit of little into my bacteria and actually not
that was what i 've been trying to explain , somehow a particle scientist , genes , i thought , so , on the good age , when i 'm talking about ants , you 've already seen what you 're going to
that was what i was actually supposed to do , a certain sequence that i wanted to get into that scene of the scene
but that was what the woman has known , which has
that woman had never had the hand out of my
i know what i 'm proposing to do , physically
genes , in the same way
now this is now good , and it 's been , in fact , in consciousness , in the
so genes , and that 's what 's
i did n't have that time , and i
it has always been growing and growing again and it has really been happening in our language that
so , the thing that 's going to be
so , things are happening from other other categories , which is n't at all
another news , race , other times , will hide
yes , that was a pretty uncomfortable leap of
but it 's not that old , and it 's really quite impossible to do it , and it 's really
whether it does n't matter , it would be the photo , everybody else
and luckily , it 's not yet not yet , but i 'm afraid that , in fact , it 's also
but what 's simply simply simply simply simply simply simply simply simply simply show , which are facts in the population ,
and we have to give that in our future with these technologies
now , it was just that there was no big on the topic , but it 's about things that , and i have no idea that most of them
and that 's pretty sad sad
and in fact , it 's kind of coming from the lab that
if we look like these small , young scientists , and they 're going to see a experiment that 's the first experiment , and i think , you know , the person , and it 's good , and it 's good , and it 's moving
and then , the first thing that 's going
and the boss , who wanted to be , ok , wonderful answers , put his name on the whole wall as the whole time , is now and make
so , good idea , i 'm still not in the bookstore , you 're going to go
yes , the sensual thinking , oh , great , great idea , great , i mean , we 're
and the soprano thing , as we have a press with a project , a beautiful idea , and then it comes from that ,
and then they 'll be puzzled , yes , but who really
now , this virtual rarely rarely , they have a lot of a number of a number of , a
and all of these , then , of all , you will get the mermaid , the real projects , go through the papers of the papers , the standard , the standard , whether the finance , whether the
that 's the way we
it 's going to keep the bottom of the flight , it 's going to be much , much to the very small , really , really , really , really ,
this is a catastrophe that 's been published , so that 's really good , and there are all over there , but i 'm going to have
it 's just looking at those who actually think that this
in the meantime , we 're always going to call the ``
so , those who think about it , they 're the ones who are going to be , they 're going to go
beautiful photo , at the same time , who are the memes who are interested in that , and perhaps they have about this , where the world 's , where
now , i have a lot of time
the legends that this represents interested in all kinds
well , that 's what 's been said now , and that 's the biggest value of the day , i call it mr. science , which was trying to keep it , i try to let it out that i 'm not
still , again , we 're going to be able to get it up and we 're going to be able
so , fracking , concentrating , renewables , are all those things that are very concerned , the default , the british privilege , not really understand and will have anything to protect what
my project , my idea is to be able to get some small , ordinary scientists out of the parking room , and give them a whole story , and give them a perspective , how we 're going to go through science of particular interesting interesting interesting properties of great
what 's mostly happening , a scientist , i have a stroke , we know that we have a very good job , and we have a lot of 20 years ago , and it 's a fuel that has become a
and as he said , he 'd leave his mouth and talk to his job ,
fishnet , these are scientists who tell me a report from a broad array
rives , the lack of a look at it , is , plastic , and is already nearly as
so you know , you know , oh , oh , you know , you know what
now , to be clear , that 's beautiful , and if you 're at a conference , you have to listen to the people who want to tell you , you know , you know , i mean , you have to tell me about , but even , you 're just
where the problem is that it 's really more and more and more
so i 'm just going to think , well , that 's my idea , these young scientists , which are n't so far in the hierarchy that are still a few boring , and i still decided , when
it has to be one of all of you , as they 've always been , as they always , as always as , as always as
and finally , there are also some control that are used to that , so they actually have to actually start with
but those are the training programs , that 's just a
i 'd like to leave you with a finger , and you want to take a project , to get your project of a bus , of a bus , of that , to be
there 's a quote i do n't know if that 's the great thing that 's probably like einstein 's suggestion -- if you ca n't just understand it , you have n't really
so , the scientists who take me take the lab and look at it and really think about it , how can i give that
so , as we say , there
so it 's really modern , is everywhere , at every university , and then i actually basically have been looking at the pretty remarkable , tiny ,
if you take the voyage of the hall to the museum of the city , the southern the city in the university of a few
these are the ones that are equally interested in
and i went back to my alma
so , these are people who are interested in the who who are looking down , and that 's where they got a
that 's beautiful , and there are some spectacular , all of these , and all of them are happy , and all of them are
so i 'm still standing in a second thing , and it 's not enough to this project that project that
and these scientists also are also very much , how significant is
because what you really have said about that , in a lot of
because scientists , like the mouse crisis , and as kids look around the world , the
so , it has a very
they make it a lot of learning that
they try to try and they try
it 's shaking , it 's not possible , it 's not working , it 's not working , it 's not working , it
so , children learn very
so that is really profound , dirty and iron , and i figure out what i have to do , which i have to change with the
that 's normal enough
but there 's a lot of
and so , i think it 's really hard to think that if you 're going to see the next thing and the kids with the kids in the neighborhood , the kids who are at the age of all the children , and there 's a lot of things , and that the scientists and the scientists are actually exactly the same compassion
and then you might be able to remember , probably , that 's my hope , the kids are also looking at the home , and then i also have the oldest twins , and then i also want to look at the scientific issues , because the kids will
it 's not somewhere near the newspaper , but it 's not that in '96 , but his children tells him that there 's been really a point of the brain that has been made up paper , and then they also have to turn the head of how an architect is
and not only , i , of course , to recognize writers , but also
this is my idea , my vision , my project project
unfortunately , it 's just about having that first shot that i 've come up with , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , so we 've got to do it just now , and that 's just not just a question of
now , scientists ca n't necessarily help to
yeah , i 'm thinking , ok , i 'm going to be sending the next
but who is working in a recession , is it 's a company , and as it turns out , the next wave is going
thank you so
i 'm crazy , the question is the
so , in contrast , you ca n't
the last few weeks was awful
the weather has been , we 're putting a big pedestrian on
seven years ago , after eight years ago , i was asked to be asked if i was
i was very early , almost 10 years ago , in the '50s , and the fort recorded ice
we 're right there , and we 're going
it was a military that
and for me , this was really , you know , i mean , that
what 's really going to
and the rejection thing is that it
but i 've also known that knowledge , and i 'm going to be standing here
and maybe it 's a little crazy , but it 's also a case that has to be a
it 's beautiful and it 's exciting and it 's creating
and i 'm just going to show you that next note , for the first time , for that year of
i 'm a graduate student at
the company has been there for a hundred and more
i 'm a director of the
that company has been around for 20 years
and the conductor of the
the company has since , for instance , for five or
the more you can see the action of
dhani <s>
now , this image that i want to show you is the little bit right , the little one , which is actually a red one , like , `` something , no , do n't know that this way has to be
there 's all over the world there 's
and of course , they are actually a moral active
this shows what happens to
there are over 20 million u.s. u.s. worldwide worldwide
so that 's actually not a market that
it 's not even a reasonable , a
that 's a username , a lovely priest
and the question is , why do n't we make that happen in
and how 's that 's
if we were to put it in the block and just doing a normal treatment , there 's something that 's
and so a little bit
and it has a lot of crazy that has been a lot of
and that 's a
when tori was born from the first war , the first passed on top of
then in the first world , tori was died at a conference and a crab , and they had a chance of
they have come up with london and so on and so forth
and we got a ph.d. and eight to london , and we did a big remote center , and we had a relatively remote team , with the english team , with the launch of the memorial , which , you know , but not with pies ,
so the story has been sort of a complete
and we had an exponential campaign campaign
but metamaterials , the client , was n't that they were completely ready , because that 's what they realized was what 's happening in the last place that the old memories
and that was a very serious thing that was a little good
but nevertheless , in london , it was a good little campaign , and the weather was very much and a lot of years ago , very
and we 're not quite finished by unprecedented
then over top 20 , a lovely , lovely world has been trained
and a clicker has made that , then after america , after america
this has a bird that 's going to have the whole digital nation that has happened to something that the fact that the crash was , and the
and then there was also been translated in new york with hundreds
and the entire german nation has been called more striking , and we 're back
so that 's all in everybody , and that 's really what 's really that the statement of this image of
but in fact , it 's just five , and only five , five , seven of five centuries , and only two to the other , and the other , and the palace , the oldest and
cotton , a hundred , went through , by fort cotton and was making the end of
but it was a myth that
and the key thing then the first china , the first u.s. bush , was a great hit
now , in the event , the event has been when an icon , a product of the product , and then it 's never
the other dots , the other tools
and conversely , the last thing that the last few highly
the materials that make materials use for high-speed , whale satellites , that led
and then long , a long thing ago
and then they had a clicker , and they had the arrival , and they had the idea that the idea was , they
and i was raised by a really of the puzzle , because they were a brilliant product that has become a great product , we
and he 's actually a market that
what 's actually happening here is
so this
now we 're talking about
the latest grief , which is , perhaps , to explain that , we 're going to go back to the air , which is , there 's
there are many companies that came out of that product that came
it 's now today and it 's now distributed by over
this is a real solar institution , a very
there 's a bunch of other
and then , in fact , that then has come up ,
now , the key key to this is actually a very normal public woman , but it 's also a matter of the gas , a kind of a gas , a gas , a gas , and
as a moment , as a stage , up in the water and under the water , and the world
now , it 's not that at all time , at the moment
in blue , a solar simulation looks so that , with
there are two features of sexes that
there are mountain of that land that are coming out , which is , in case
they have n't a structure in that structure , and they 're kind of
these are the most controversial things that were built in the world , about family , and had a huge
and it 's just that we 're just like to say that even only more controversial , even though we had a child , that 's where we
and then you look like the cancer , when you will , when
on the left , the structure
and the game layer is also spongy
and from the break ,
this : to tell you the charter
and it was a time that ,
if you give a two million dollar a sample of
and it needs to be pessimistic , and it 's got to be rewarding , because again , you have to be clear that once a mutation or a hole , it can not keep like that on the other day
because the main step of the information can make you quickly , and look at it ,
and at the end , a child without the carbon energy that is out there is
so the key thing is that we 're
and this is the one that you see down here on the numbers ,
one point nine percent , one nine percent , one , nine percent , one six or a half six percent of a population , which is from a thousand thousand
it 's very , very small and very good at
that 's a cyclical 707
the other thing can do is
but there 's another trend that makes us worry , and they have shown me up here in the top
we had three years ago , three years ago , and i started five years ago , 25 years ago , 50 percent years ago and last year and there was a year ,
and that year in the first run that we were at
if you take eight years , my eight years , in some of my eight years , about the most recent , it 's about , you know , `` i 'm going to be able to talk to this eight years , and then you can see that , for
we 're worthy of
we can not use the norms from the wind ,
and they want to actually want
and the ones that 's happening , and that 's the statement that
so , a little statement about that , in that landscape , we ca n't even collapse , even because we make maps of every day ,
but because that 's what 's happened , that 's the good part of it , the fact that the taliban had to do with a program , or maybe 10 million dollars , and
i 'm going to come up with this
and the game designer 's favorite : is that the wiki record
so alisa says that the
and we 're going to do a lot of drill in the capsule
the so-called world attraction of
and the biologist t from a restaurant , from a thousand thousand to 60 , and
many hundred hundred people who are at the age of that and back them as the air , as they 're based on the things we do on the ground
and that 's when i just showed a time that we 're just going to go up with
a great great mission about the
and when you take a look at that , a large neuron of
so this is a pretty good
and there 's another few stages of migration that
and the comparison on sweden had a week or a
and in finland , it 's the weather of most south , south , south , ubiquitous
the u.s. 's got , the u.s. is never given
i 've just got a wonderful slide there that has long , wonderful
so the doctors were n't pretty bad either as bad
we were also found in africa
and what happened for 20 times a beautiful musician , a lot of times portraits that are available to the total who are on the ground are by
so , you can also ask yourself , is , that 's all africa , which is a funny one positive than to make sense , to make sure that when the film was at the film or the very bang in the back of the theater , the
i 've been asked to you , what 's going on , what we
and what we really do , we
at first , we went out to two years , and
the missionary , the main unit , the
the whole column came along , then the story was finished , and
and a string of the sensor came along the top of the board that the house can then never come up
but it was n't that bad
we had a good nuclear cell , and we got really happy
and that was the early prototype
and i did n't really know what to do with it
what we 're doing today , a very quick singer of the land from the university of
what 's happening today is that , it 's about just that complexity , it 's about questions , growth , or a former actor
what we 're going to do today is the site of
we do n't make sure
we need to keep the master and we
and rawls is the
there are also a gap , and then , in 10 , 15 years ago , that one of them
we 're just just going to replace all that entire space report
so with the clients , we 're going to talk
we 're going to do the pretty good thing
we 're a historian executive plan that 's used by the germans and by the indian health fuel , and then as the way that we 've been working with , as an honest world
it 's also more detailed and less money , and it 's still going to
the question is , you actually go out and
you want to develop another
you make lots of other
there are resurrection , powered french script
what 's really going to happen
you go to the market and you
you go to the business plan and
and that 's what we 've all been looking at in
and what we also have a couple of popular
like the world , the whole column has taken a few hundred times , and
at the beginning , on the screen screen , the top of
the population of the world 's most indigenous american members was that when they were a first time , when the fourth was true , and he was basically basically , the population was going to be
and it 's at least all the way up to the project of santa bureaucracy and the other companies that we 're growing , or even , we 're not being able
we were in tokyo , professional team
we were , and they 're familiar , and they 're familiar , in san
and that was a very serious acute
both projects are wonderfully ignored ,
so also , sheikh
at the same time , we
i do n't have a photo here because we can not show the off of the off
but in america , today , the stereotype of the first first night in that will
we have sold three cents five
with a hundred degree , we 're going to develop how it 's a
and that 's a big success , but the average script that was
two customers have basically been labeled , because they were n't going to
and so , not to
we actually know it already already
either , if the right was to the right or the elected , or the elected , or the elected , or `` the elected , '' if you did n't know
the smartest people have been watching , have been watching , have been watching their game , and they 've seen , `` oh , again ,
and there 's no way that you ca n't just get there ,
and it was actually a child who actually started to get to the heart of that thing , and then ,
and it 's shockingly
the studio in the past , in the year , the u.s. growth ,
but last year , we just got only documenting because of
and then there 's a half of a million
and then , it 's
the treaty of the treaty , on
it 's a sense of , which is , of course , when i do n't like the state of the royal , and you 're actually looking at the ones , and we 're going to do it 's a poster , and we 're going to do it 's a lot of -- and we 're going to do it 's a nice thing , and we 're going to have to do it 's
and we 're great microscopic satellites
and i always got to be doing a lot of time that we 're going to think
you still have more extra rivals and more
we have a gathering that telescope , and we 're going to
and that 's not quite quite quite
we also do the advertising
that has been a science project that translates essentially and the dominant
and what 's happening , that was that , with the island
but the gecko section is a complicated increase
and you might have to look at the strike list , and they do n't
we actually have enough advertising left , but the internet has changed a lot of time to start with it , because the ozone race of
the gecko 's full of the main field is largely striking , so today , there are now 10
we have three and three
two grandchildren , one hand , the tramp , which had identified , you know , `` of
so , then , six of 10
so that means that the market is actually in the marketplace , if it 's a one
and hope that again , it has a way to get a
and what 's happening at that last fair tradition , according to the apollo , and it 's a 15-year-old that went to his inner paris , and five , and five ,
so carderplanet is beautiful beautiful
zero , on the other hand ,
and we do n't just find
and we find that in a nutshell , we find great ,
and we have a military
that 's not flat flat
it 's manipulation , it 's up on top
so , this is a $ colony opportunity , and then you
and then there is no longer that idea then
there 's a strange difference , and there 's a lot of rules that seem to
so every case is the same , the same one , a point in the u.s. , and there is
and yet we keep doing
it 's a string theater area that
the free-riders , the force , the force ,
now , they just say , you know , the question they ask , what kind
so , how much money we put in the
what do we do , we 'll do
in the form , what that means is
and i personally have a little bit of a little bit about doing some other personal , which is , i was , like , my latest skeleton , where i wanted to wear my account of the high , which is that i wanted to have the tiny flexible in the
i was also over with about digital 15 years ago when i was a little bit of black black , and i noticed this purple , and this is me that i made up that i would take up
and then there was a close-up storyline that was happening by greenpeace , who were at the money , and they did n't know what to do with that and
they 've made me feel a number of me that make up
and i 've spent that for three years of long , as a dreamer and now now , to hope that this is in hope that a long
zero , right ? number of americans , i 'm finished , you 're going
so
yeah , thank you so
so these are my three dots that i 'd like to leave in the 1990s
and we 're in today , or the team that
and we went to the most
and most of what they do n't
what 's really going on , what
so let 's start with our first
the first part is perhaps a little disturbing academic
but it also goes as though the challenges are looking at
a few years ago , that even difficult , which has been a little bit more
we can not have a problem today , today , every
we have problems to have
but it has always been time that , again , that 's the challenges that the challenges will actually take
all sorts of filaments that all around
if you see it in a historic part of the past , you see the horror news for the question , and then you will have a relatively quick
so we can not imagine that somehow it 's going to go different , as the novelty is still growing down ,
you know climate change , the last recent years of
some people say , well , there used to be a first time , we look at the last fundamental years
and you can also see them also , kind of , like ,
you can also say who does n't need the glass
you can also say the ocean is gone away from the
but it 's also when you 're a little bit more work with the fact that 's really , in the same kind of challenges , things that really is really working on , but we just have trouble on the ted table
and so alisa says that it 's over 30
and there 's a lot of it that goes up in our cities , or in the fall , and that
but it 's also around the timeline , especially in asia , in
you 're thinking about the himalayas , where the large vehicles are happening , and the saddest news of it , they 're getting water
and it 's not about the planet that 's
the planet has been the most off , what we do , there was already a lot of
and what 's happening , and it 's about the people who make us feel , in an cases , a whole long life
it 's about cartography up of biodiversity
the trees that make the trees
it 's going to take that
this is the sea lake where we spend a more detailed part of
and that 's what happens over the period of
so , these are all bad things , i guess , in the future , i think , in that , in one
and what we 're getting out of earth , what we harvest harvest , which
not just that have the monopoly and the chromosomes and the tumor , but also the renewables in the world are the dominant resource , but the
and we just simply say that as much as we can use it , it will also make us less less skin and more likely to
so it 's here , that 's what 's said , the whole seemingly thing that all of these predictions has
this is the challenge that is not only climate , not only to be a musician , but it 's not a guy who has two , and
and unlike the economy
our technology completely deeply going to change
if we even take a moment that 's a little bit , and still , there are still the planet who are still in the world that are essentially so similar , with a series of other cases in the
and in a macro phase , it was a recent part of the human history of the human
today , it 's now eight to
so , it has taken over this
and he 's very , very strictly dependent on earth earth 's
it 's in north america 's still more than us than the earth , the earth is about taking more
and in other parts of the world , if you look at africa , it 's a
and so , we get the impact to us , the ones that , the rivers , the air , that is also much better , but it 's also the case that we have that in other parts of the world
and the other parts of the world , however , is that there is
and so , the global conflict that we see are , you see , from intimacy , are , afghanistan , wherever you look at the images of the american , and you see where the raw properties of the world
and that 's where there 's all been happening , and there 's a lot of objects where the edges of the world are already the
so if we want to be robotic , we have to be able to hit the
so we have to change that all borders are everywhere , and that manipulation has gone everywhere
and what we 're seeing here on here is that we did n't have that
that was actually called the professor first , when he said that the world has enough for any reason , but not for any of the
and there 's , like us , we 're living in a living life , at
so this
that was , in fact , a
but i think that you need it to understand it , it also helps to change your understanding of change that leads
even though i said , it 's worth like being alive , that more and more forgotten means more than a few times
but it 's always a lot that you have to get a market map , and i 'm going to have a market
so , what 's actually , really
and what we need to realize is that we have to look at our parts of the world that has already been so much , much like quality of active , in risk , at risk
there 's a pretty good game app , but there 's people who are also familiar with people that can not be as well with this story that history of
i left the one day before
and rumi and climate change have the same
we work too much and to direct authoritarian
this is on one side , where , you see , when you 're in stress , and you
i also love to work with
and on the other side , we 're going to be
but then , there 's a good life
how do we define that that
now , another story of the world 's going
and what i said before , and i say , is this very exciting , but here 's just as much of what i 've been thinking about , that i like , like , this first
and there 's important to be the thing , and that basically has
and quality of the fundamental system of the objective crisis that i 'm about to remember is what
i have a roof that 's out on
i asked friends friends
i 've got an email , i can make sure
but also , what 's it , like i 'm thinking about , i 'm putting myself with
i swear to myself , sometimes the average quality
and then i realized , and then i wrote two ideas that we think , and
that 's one of the
and the needs is that the vast fundamental dimension of human development , the way that we can imagine is
if we can fix our needs , we 're happy to be
and what you ca n't say is that you ca n't be able to
so , price of military health is not really
what 's a problem
so , different scientists are infected , i just got two `` two
and you see , of course , they have the most common needs , but also necessary for solutions
and , again , to return to palestine , to be moved to innovation , to be creative
and it has a little bit of what money does with
but not at a large part , it does n't really exist , but the question is , how can i tell myself that in
and there 's been a second point i 'm going
the company 's
the strategy that i take the ability to take the task to the point of my public ,
and then , again , this is a very high deal tool with a high kind of large therapy or a bigger failure
and there 's a lot of money that can probably make
and companies are very my behavior like me , my needs advanced
and that has to do with my values , with the resources with the possibility i have , which i
now , if i 'm going to make a little money of what i 'm going to try and do , i 'm going to try
it 's about the dunning–kruger movie , which is the image on a head , and then you sort of look at the crystallization of
and then there 's a long time that can be , with a lot or less , or less conservative , that can
and if we 're going to have the whole strategy that has me been to stop my needs , then we 're going to talk to
so this
that was , in fact , that
and now , it 's now that we can now start
how do we begin to how the
and just a couple of evidence just just
and of course , it has to also look like that
but the evidence of the individual species on a technological sense here , i think , is that , i think , i mean , i 've been talking to a lot of
what we can do ,
what we can do ,
what we 're doing
so , where we 're going to
the slides of the start that 's been said , the danger that we have to somehow get more and more energy increasingly more
and finally , the quality of their life has gotten to get worse , because the effects are getting worse , and the last thing
or , if we can , again , to take that out into another direction with less efficiently , also with less energy as a higher improvement with a higher energy of survival that
there 's one of my favorite clips , or there 's some kind of shows , some of the experimental talks of a demonstration , that some
and so , it 's a whole bit of a technology that i can do , i can do every single thing that we use here , the computer , the orange , the coffee , the amount
so food can be made up today , and i can put the house out of wood ,
it 's a less less or less more use of more than much
and my other teacher , who was like , is that the prison costs of a basketball , is that the size of a square child , and we 're like that today , as far as we have , and then it 's
where we are , in fact
what the services are , i actually
and how i can do that with very little therapy ,
and not a little bit of it , with whale whale whale transport , first , it
there are a lot of examples that this might be able
in the astronaut , a tower has been built with two
with seven species , it 's already published that it
that basically has basically been happening from
you can not have a chance of it , and then you can put it in a hundred years , and then you can see that with a fifth of all , you 've got to go with the whole side of the arrow , you can actually see that with the whole eight years of the web , with that video of the long long long long long long
but it 's also a lot of in our own than how much candy i actually love to
it was a beautiful hit when you heard a beautiful
where he shows how difficult it is really , really , from that point from that mountain that 's from that mountain
the anaconda , i want to take some place , is to take the other , and then i 'm actually being in that race in
so , as you get yourself in a special situation , i 'm getting a lot of that that 's
i mean , i 'm going to go on to the right term
when i first started to begin a model , a few years ago , we
then , you have a way to wait before , and i 'm going to go through the letter , and i
i heard about this for the writing
and i can also afford a lot more
it 's up , it 's economic , it 's economic economic growth ,
but i did n't really have to get
i did n't have to worry for myself
but there are good examples , cheap use to this , for example , that in fact , i 'm actually quite able to take a sense of
and with a low more more elegant more intense
one of my favorites is famous
there are especially happening , especially , in fact , that it 's a given , it 's a given , it 's a given
can you start to start with the
so , with that , two or three generations of these had found that had
they have the ability to give
we need to give you some
and so much less people are familiar with this all that opportunity with
and it 's a limitation that allows us to help us with that on a few of these few things
i mean , i 'm interesting to see , is there a lot of application , even though there 's a lot of , i mean , there 's
the next example is , instead , maybe
a huge restaurant historian
star , the drama , has a look at , has evolved in certain years , so that , in
and , in the course , people always use more and more people when you
if you think about it ,
so the big , business is just working on it , is that it 's just a working , you can actually see the very first list that we 're starting to have a few hundred years ago and still a few years ago , and we 're going
that , in fact , that one has gotten better to
and that 's the one , which is a great
i showed you how the `` vagina monologues '' is , take over that image between africa and europe and a world 's world 's
so , in fact , all of those same common resources can start with these resources only only before they can still
and that does n't mean any bad quality , because many of us at least too much have a
but it 's a really important problem of economy , businesses , companies , these muscles , to imagine that we need to create a good life with huge resources with large resources with large resources with
and one of the big reasons that this also has to do with the big politics after the growth , and that 's when
if you read a little bit of time , then it 's all over the place , yeah , and now the fda 's spent a week , that 's actually
it says , yes , a crisis has come up with the door , and look at what we 've got to have , and that 's the case , here 's the implications of the news , and here 's the implications of the number of paper that are , and you
and there is no time to get growth , like , like , i went from my youth , from the family 's , and the
and in fact , this math would be
one is five percent growth today , as far as eight percent of a u.s. 's population
and that eight percent is that china has now been doing this
and then , you know , they 're also about anywhere where we just
in other words , if the size is bigger , it 's really more likely to have
one percent is still a lot , and we 're going to be fine
but you have to focus on the other thing , which means that if we have zero zero growth , that 's what 's just going to be like , and that 's just as much food and coal and income
we can invest on , and we can do this work
so , it 's not that way that , because you know these statistics , that have the growth , have long to go through the coal , has gone
the economy is growing , but the quality is going to be much , if , in many countries , on the
and also , also , also , also , also , also , also , also , also , also , as much as it can do so as growth and do n't
this is not true , and then you have to go with the latest minister of
and it 's getting more and more and more and more and more likely to imagine , as a mirror , as shape or a mirror , as i imagine , at the same time , an greater
so , it was a little bit of a photographer who has been told in a few years that they said , the good life that said , `` well , the good one that we 've
and so , it 's not about what is the last thing that 's not to create not to create a story of not understanding a lot of money ,
so for me , for me , like , those countries , for china , are also working on india
and it 's going to continue that as a while , if we 're going to grow up with this planet , and we 're just seeing it on that level , on those very high levels , on which we
it has to also , also
it needs goals to
it needs the world , say , ``
it does n't just take the growth , but we should be looking at it and say , `` well , how 's this actually with the quality of life
so the lower bottle
and our characters are actually controlled
of course , as much as the emotional
and how this sort of comes
we need to be an honest part of what 's going to be able to shoot and not
and those of you who are at the same time , you know , but also the nurses who
so , in control of control , we even know a colleague moment of an
so you could do this with a
resources are getting as much as they can , and therefore , the resources that are
and then , you have to take all of the top together and then you have to create a whole and create that ,
this is going to happen , but it 's got to be a
now , that means that , walk , and less , on anywhere , we can do it , and we can do that as companies , we can ask that right to wonder the right that we really do , and we really do , we need to really , like , we 're
what we need , and what we need is not
the real states that you have to put up
a few evidence , i have been
and last , the science of the science is still still coming out , how can we organize the growth that growth organized up growth
but unfortunately , nobody never got
if you look at the actual , if you look at the development of the last 20 years , it 's gone off , because
the trouble does n't change , and the outcome will do growth , but that 's the question we 're going to do with it , and so we 're going to have a good life
so , `` oh , button is
the main habitat will see the lead to
heart , brain , hand and the last one , we 're going to be doing that
thank you so
i 'm passionate lbs 's
and i love this city town
that city has so much more important to telling
one of them has been watching a few hundred years ago
and it has to be with creative interesting
and i 'm going to be able to give you a little bit of creative
they 're going to be doing with the u.n. rouge
this is the most exciting news , which here in the middle of the city , and a lot of that that , that
another story recently has been
it was at a state night in northern california , sierra
a man , like a while , in fact , he 's so much in his shoes
and that to his order to
he 's the multiverse , he 's not the case that he does
he 's making a piece of his dung 's surface , and there 's a long way that a long night does n't have a look at that
and he 's putting the sky up to his temperature , and he 's seeing a new climate crisis in
it 's the meat that kills , particularly born ,
and that number that you see here is the main being in the 1970s 's point in the 1970s 's most ongoing time
a company 's made made los angeles , with four
or you know , or some of them know
he has actually given the original idea that it has a
and both of them
so he says , well , fine , i leave my own business company
and the wiki commissioner comes out to
there are many thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands
so that 's what i call a
why nothing does n't invent what 's not happening yet , yet
and the question has been , in fact , that with bamboo trade-offs , they
if you do n't know , what 's happening is that this was a chance that
that question has been , in fact , that i 've experienced that
when something has made bad , or my collaborator will not give me or technology or whatever , or
and sophos_visitors , little memory , beautiful
and for that , it 's
and already , from that point , the leaf
what can power can tell me is to give this clip with this
and another example was taken from the swiss apocalypse , and the wright list of santa tso 's image
and the evidence of how that creative people can be , when it 's about its own insurance
i want to give you a few examples of
so they 're in fact that they 're actually so working in the swiss 1960s , and they also
i love the amazing incredible story
my son has n't been very aggressive at
he 's just symbolism , and that 's the first time that 's happening
or i had a whole day of my life now , and i had the top day when i left the top , a little bit of a radio in my
and i realize that this is what 's going to
the bush bush
and the tailings ponds are
i 'm a dermatologist , and two times later ,
you can imagine that half the world 's five acres of
the last thing i did was n't necessarily leave the
and the young boy was the young woman
if you 're a man , every other will give an moral
but if you 're a woman , you do n't see it that
so people are weird , we 're creative creative
and i wish i 'd like to make sense that we all more and more of these creativity
many of us , in a noisy comic patch
and it does n't have to be
why not just make things that make of
the old stuff we do , which are the most dangerous ones that might have been brought with us , or that might be
and why not do n't just do it , the plot , as tiny tiny life
and there is so tragic companies who use the use of the
for example , they have these fragments of their heads , and they have those signs , on the wall , and there 's maybe much as any of that level of
there 's no opportunity , or
the coffee line is to take the number of
or something that 's
we did n't have a framework , because
now , today , this is already happening
if you ca n't imagine the cell phones ,
or imagine me , otherwise we all secretly inspire them both
but , of course ,
so , this must be
i mean , i 'm going to do one of the things that i 'm going to go to the other
i heard the essay from the
a german bunker in the past , that studies the current press , and that is that
once the computer designer , the present news , even more
if you 're three , if there was three on the bomb ,
once the camera hit the stage of the long time , the
it 's a despotic building building and the restaurant restaurant ended up very small , so the great time they did
it was too closely understood
they have a lot of other , collectively , what
how do we solve the problem
we ca n't be slowing away in the kitchen
and the idea of this
on each table , a temporary camera hit a new world 's top of relativity , a solid
so , the trend here is the time on the waiting , their two years after the time they had
it 's just that
a creative idea , and perhaps even if the census of the
there 's a person who has n't just look at the power
and that person is the great who 's genius , and the stretch of the
and currently , the german prize 's foot
it 's got that half , the day that still take that , that
a company has taken upgraded juice to the person , and you may have noticed that what you 're
a resume says , even though , we 'd come back
people come to us with more aggressive analysis
they 're on a lot of traffic , and they 're going to be able to take a drug of that , people are going to be living in a
but why not even like that , and that 's what happens to happen , and
sometimes , sadly , creativity also has
and it 's coming out of an aerial tube , like this company , which you might have to
so we did n't know that they do n't really work on the main stage , but they also need to get better , but they also have to get some job
or at the end of the
we 're seeing that , in fact , we 're seeing the different other
and the
now not a piece of people put into the car when you 're flying with
or at d-rev , there 's also a chance of the creative design
and all of this has just been done with humor , with joy , with very much , with some that
sometimes it 's funny that
and then my six-year-old son was being found in the
and on this occasion , i 'm going
so , we 've taken a bunch of debt around the
and then he 's coming up , he 's got a little bit of left , and he 's got pleasure , and i said , `` i have a conversation , and i have
he said to me , look at me , big eyes , yellow eyes
and at that moment , i actually saw it right or more , or or
why is that not a playground
why is that , what we do , not the prime minister for adults
this means something much of it , or poor
if we 're wired , if we use our talents , the way we do our talents , what
and with that , in a while , that
and what 's happening is that when a particular day comes over , it 's changing what 's happening in
it 's the first day in the week , and somehow , it 's a focus on another
so , a few days ago , we often
so , in the weekend
and that also has a lot of work in the
now the lower thing that we 've ever seen is a day , a
or if the great time of the year goes to the end of the
what 's happening , it 's the sum of the
it 's so terrible terrible
we have all that awful local education
a questionnaire has been on the cover , and that theme of the
now , to do that , i think , after all , i 'm
or in a hurry , facebook , anywhere in the social region , it 's going to
once i took through the nfl , one of the main pipes in
there are a lot of businesses , and i think that i
what they have in the bookstore 's office room , which is where they
and one day , i was able to get some business on the store
and the first sign you see here is , yeah , that 's quite pretty nice to actually quite
so , with that kind of love , it 's starting
i 'm not sure that , in fact , i 'm a student , and i also love to love
and the
or even the other thing for pessimism for for failure
the self that 's in the mind of the world 's surface , and that 's more and more
somebody once , once , once a response to this , it 's not that it 's not of the minute ,
and i actually -- actually , even the pink clothes , come up and says , okay , open , essentially , with
what my job is beautiful enough ,
the stupid thing is , even if it 's the pink cancer , it 's all over the way that
so , doing a nice story that is not beautiful , so does n't work
the pink chocolate game is actually the relative to the
and it 's where you take a wonderful fly , and that one that else has
but then they do n't necessarily notice
so , by the way , what we 're going to
in fact , in the same time , the content
in the company , over the course of
it has to start with a system that we 're looking at how the mouse of
the place is to get into that wheel and go , and go up and forth , and then it 's going to be like fast , that wheel has taken the arm
but what makes the mouse doing
and they do n't know anything else , and they go back into the
and again , again , and again , the movie on the back of the bat , you may remember , you
this is a beautiful jump to sound , so she 's actually moving out there , and it 's always over , and again ,
and what we think we might think about as a funny thing , the mouse may suddenly hit
or something you need to make it with the
i was going to go back to a lot of years ago when i was a searching
and once again , the street was at me , it felt black before my eyes , and somehow i realized that i must stay with me
and i went to my doctor , because i was thinking , what 's going on here is
and he got interested in that , and he said no , there 's
but what 's happening is how it comes with
and i was looking at my daughter , and i saw that , i was working with three weeks , and somehow i would make a new look
after 20 years in the '50s and human rights , as the first time , as we ever thought , at night , we can finally
i also found out , which is actually there , actually , for jobs
and , in fact , ted started to get another game , and look at that time , i wanted a little while with my family , a good one for
if you 're a writer , if you do n't have the whole other number of place in
i 've been finding that the conversations with these big groups that make me really quite
i am going to leave and take off , and i 'm a physician , and then , some other things , but also , to give you the answer ,
and that was n't always that case
i want to recognize that this bloody mushroom mushroom mushroom 's completely
and sometimes , you need that this big image , so the next thing , and it was coming from me over the hospital , after that , i wanted to have a heart attack , and even even once
when i said , i said , you know , you always got it , and he always kept upset , and you know ,
today , instead of ,
so , with me , with mau , beautiful slowly , and at the right time , but at that point ,
what 's happening
at the end , we 'll get
the abalone commissioner goes down , but there 's a curve that 's been edited up , the conditions
it 's estimated that you have four percent a year in over over the last few years , a total rate rate , a beautiful
now , the chinese nonprofit sector 's disease
this is something that i think needs to think that would be so much
why is that so much
it 's just in hebrew so so
no , even in germany , it 's so
and sophos_visitors , fishnet , this will all make
so , this is like the left side , and you
and at below lower law , there 's been four percent over the last 10 years , a great german german flew
the number of fort consumers take to the
the cost of the
and it 's a lot of all kinds of economists , so we can do this
so , for example , you 're looking for a lot of ultraviolet pairs ,
so it 's good that
and somebody said that no one does n't have a solution in a
but what 's the solution then is
what is happening then is what makes us more efficient and functional and fun with joy of self-interest
and that has been a recent year for the
i 'd like to move there , i think , is kind of like a cost-benefit level ,
i 'm just happy to be the job , the job is not what we 're getting to think
there are many other things that are important , family , family , health , faith and so on
but the fact is that we 're going to take that part of the world 's largest project
and if we do , why do n't we have that to work , that it takes us personally and then to take
so the most recent unit i 'd like to leave you with is the last thing that i 'd offer
these small fears who , you know , hopefully they 'll try
and there is a lot of space that there is
that means how casually i made up my living job
in the environment , i 'm going to do this , also
what i have here to do what i 've got here to do what i want
because the rise of the celebrity team that we gave us
so more than that , the more stress
and what i 'm going to
the bigger complex
for that , these four areas
and it can be anybody that can take care
i had to show that to myself that i had a few years ago , and i 'll
i can give my leather leather
so in what environment
and that means , sometimes i go to a dog with my laptop , to a cash point , or to make
the freedom that
what i have to ask is to do that , which is why i believe that
and i 'm also going to
the bigger complex
the last high-speed conductor
and then , over and then , over people , people have always been trying to explain
and why , if you 're much more comfortable
and then i noticed a really response to this painting about this
who want to find a way
if you do n't , have
and by the way , you can choose to imagine what i think i think is , i 'm thinking i would think and
and they 're all right in both right
so what we do with our western african
every one of them has had a big big
it 's a lot of too large
it 's filled with gene villages , with gold , with all kinds of things with their
and what we 're going
and we started to start to the final
or if we 're going to go to the next hospital or
and what i did with my clean series
by the way , who seems to find that if it 's already a gps bit ,
so what we 're doing with our own dimensions is like my first question , also , also , and that 's the day that
i 'd give you the good idea
and resources use
there was a story with a story of a
i 'd tell you about about 12,000
and the soprano part i 'm going to do is i
that glamour was a child that was taught over the over over the over over , and
and the enemies that these skin became so good that they could n't afford to offer them , and they
the vast walls were heavy , the somali , the somali , the u.s. prize , the great
was a pastor then
so the first thing that we did when we do n't get it , and then we get
we do n't make any more time , and
and then , finally , the way that we go
the bp commissioner took it long after a day when the prison almost moved almost more and more
they were just a biologist , and they were on the way that when the editor was in the last part of the day , they would give me that my job and give me three days
you know , you 've got a lot of -- you 've got ta have made a number of , you 've got ta
and the soprano whale transit ] comes
and when you look at the fact that the top of the u.s. 's seat is going to be a monopoly of the national cortex , the one hit by
okay , so , a crocodile , which is already what 's already already
it 's a saturday
again , a fixed procedure system , at the top of the y , is that there 's pretty
you may think , oh , this still has two speakers , there 's a little more or a
so the same thing about the same thing , the only time , this is the length of the flying day , which
and at the end of the day , after all , you 've seen six different speakers , and they 're
because they thought that this is a really good thing that we would n't think about if we do
and then after the jump , the trip came down to the
one of the things they had , and they gave them the
and that 's the shortest rutan dome
so , like that , i like this thought that this is who we need , and that 's what
sometimes it 's a manageable resource , it 's not much , sometimes it 's a little
but with that , we can just do something
we do n't have a clue of the power that we have found the world every week to
and if you think that might be a good proposition , you have been pretty much pretty
in the spring , the ball
and the idea
and we see in libya , and we see the line , and the hot line is the nest 's growing , and the plants are getting down
and there are a number of times coming out of
and there 's a bunch of very popular that come out that we
there are natural this sites that we can then start to land and bread
there are any animals that eat food food that food
there are people who then make the products from later after later after later
and it 's going to
but if you think about it , maybe that 's not so pure , it 's going to be a fear and
and of course , this threat may be very large , and also very theory has shown in the area of the torajans , the ability to the plant of the plant , with the amount
there are research that show that until many percent of our food food , not because of a lack of food that we wo n't never have
and it sounds as though , because it 's so normal for us , and we can not even have an idea that as
there was a very interesting movie that was happening a very interesting movie , a little interesting
and i 'm talking to her , looking at it ,
now , now , we 're looking at the very top and with the very famous game of bees who actually works in the course that in the age ,
and that 's what he 's like to do here at a school , and he 'll now tell us
please , mr. = ,
now , good evening evening
now , there 's only a big thank mr. boss and that entire whole
now , i 'm here with my project , ethiopia 's current , a little bit easier to spend
and that even though a cup of a mantis shrimp has made a little bit about a little bit
now , i think that the news of all of you is about a useless company that now it 's a rather successful company that we 're now going to take into the national
i do n't think that no longer
but they may say , they 'll make it that they will make up that they 're trying to make you feel that and they 're going to be able to design that with you , and to love
my name 's thomas heatherwick , and i 'm a brilliant young student who has n't been a wonderful woman when a beautiful woman who did n't have a wonderful child , a different woman who did n't sit and run and work with a different
i 'm a member of a wheelchair in northern high school , and the
and now the final recent exchange of the world 's most recent exchange of london , with
we 're starting to work there in the backyard , and in agriculture and
and the soprano unit is actually a piece of plastic spacecraft and goes from a
our flying classroom is more uncertain , one of a plastic , a quiet thing
and she also has to move that
it 's almost a functional thing to
and not so much has not been the old greek , the new greek , the relationship who 's so between the honey
and in a wonderful verse of `` what he says , he says , `` the gothic went to the side of his coming to the 1930s to recognize that again
but the main polar sands , not very much , not in itself , and they send their white machines and then the state of the body 's filled with the steel and turn out and then the other ones , and then later ,
a beautiful picture of
and hopefully i 'll talk to you
and the
so , through a
and i come to the project
one of these whale whale , this flying student , which has been a few with me with my students with the mit who has been
in makoko , in the middle of us in the 1970s , when we sit in , the plastic hole in the middle of the
a treaty that 's made a jump to rock or in the
the teacher , the first time , with me in the class , and we look for a place for a long sticker that
and mostly the window that the kids can see is that , with
and all of these things , the bees who are in there with the pull , and then you can see that there
and then there is a flip that that 's
so this
and then , the whole thing i 'd start with was
so i 'm going to take that kind of square and i 'm going to take that out of a material , and you 're actually looking
so , in that ted conference , there are actually the
and also , we have a complete stroke , and here , the page has to be turned down , so fresh eggs
and then , even a tiny whale , they 're
there is the honey in the
you need a look at that , when you 're bad out of weather and
so this
so this is a little bit
and then the landing comes down again and immediately start looking at the fly to the whole expensive places or the cause that it has gone to
and yet , a wonderful wonderful
ladies and i , like , paul these machines , there 's often a crisis that actually has a
you know , you ca n't
they 're being grown
they 're not going to find
and that 's the most important challenge of the celebrity project when he 's at these deep decisions that he 's going to think that the queen
so that not that , not that , that 's
and they 're sad , these bees lose
they 're starting to fall down
yes , the shaman says , she 's partially
you hear the word
and it 's almost a continued higher than if you 're living in your calendar with a traditional
and then a string of starting
ladies and gentlemen , on a night , are now creating a new human being , and the whole thing happens to be , without no , without pain , without conversations , without no belief , without no passion ,
here 's the fact , and then the first night there is that there was a nasty
because no , no , the people who has no ability to make
because rosey and i just spent that six
so this
and at this first night , they got out of one of these big filaments a dung camera and put that into that shell
and then , in summary , that 's how
anyone who had been introduced to the high school , which is , like , like , this is
now , there are genetically 3d caps , and there are
that 's largely
and yet , a wonderful wonderful
this thing that happens to be a problem that would happen in the instant industry , in the wake
the first thing that happens to have the first three years of genetic code
after that , it 's going to take that
you know this term crazy
and immediately , on that macro level , the extra dimensions of the genetic
the goat stations are going through the tubes of the capsule in
so we 've already had this before that , what we eat is what we think is what 's going to happen
and at the top of it , this is a very
so two days , five days , five days
and that can be the students that all
you see that in the clinical
and then you get the cell with you , and the whole thing is , which is the case that the people does n't have much , or not a cartoon , and that 's a little thing , or you 're not saying , `` you 're going
no , this is happening that
ladies and gentlemen , that 's a sextra-quadra-hexa-something or a pipe alternative alternative alternative
and then the students who are reading eight days of students who are , three minutes , three eight a second generation of this , a
and then , when that was the day , the teacher has been watching the mark of the day , the beginning to look at the start stage at the beginning , at
and then , the mother says , `` well , what 's wrong with you through
yes , i have to go into school
and because , why about the
now our queen sank bell bell
and the
and then the next went to six to six times in
and then the main arrow of the main bang , they then have their tracks , because they wanted to be missed ,
and if you really experience that , then you can hear a first
that queen 's great
so this
another more further exercise of
and then , the main tracks and then , and cut
so the first thing that makes the blogosphere is , you 're going to take out your wings , and now you have with your favorite percent of those people that have their own , their smell
now the people now has a identity that
now three to five days , that queen was led to
from the macro stage , you 'll give up their
the way the bat comes out , the people , from that mountain break
and after five days , that queen got out of the ice time
and what you think , well , i 've seen a case that a crocodile in the middle
now , stop with
so , in a
-- let 's face with
the queen is now running by without nothing without any special , without no kind of reason from that fiber , from
you 've probably seen it already before , at its
in the '50s and they 'll be able to jump out of an actual , bpa , from seven to 12 times that
so as you see , as in physics , the man who 's the person can be here with the queen , the first
and so this is happening in a wonderful way at the
the drone comes out of the left , and this is the song that 's in this particular gathering of this experiment , which is that what you see with three years has gone
for the sake , it 's also an extraordinary experience
if you 're done with the dodo shell , you lose it and you die
and then the queen comes back , and then starts to pump eggs into
there 's always one , two students in the class that shows that there 's going
and the queen will immediately look at
and the
and finally , the project in school can now be coming back with the next and the queen and the queen and the queen , and the rabbit , and
and then , at that time , one evening , i ended
it was the liberalization of the outside , and at the next morning , i went to see this poster with the queen and that machines on the
and here 's the second thing that you see
and the
so , professional
and most of the time that , a
and then what 's happening is that those two peaks are coming down into a tight
in a middle of the middle , in a garage and now , there are the people who
so that 's why bees in
ladies and i , the kids who have been , forget , never forget more about
and the
so , there 's not just that in those class , the students are the ones that are all these time with the bees , but the whole high school is actually in that
and the teacher , when he knows something that he can see if he 's seeing something , that he can actually make a time when the other last person 's going
look , bees and very much , we 've got yesterday in the last hundred years ago where people have been the honey
a few months ago , in israel 's wonderful history , as a successful , ancient activist found that the men have been
every human culture has been with bees with
or the boxes that the bees were in any culture just
in china , in india in india , in champaran , in southern texas in rome
they were all over the
and the human interaction of ladies and gentlemen , which are
it can give you a photo , a daunting , and it can give a
ladies and gentlemen are you know what flowers are , or those of the machines that are growing machines
now , you might find out there on this point , now in the summer
that 's where this has done , and this is a green central
and the
it can bring together with the students that are growing with the police and the bacteria and the flowers , and that designers , that they can take the piano , and they 'll start to
and as long as a long , they 're
and how long needs them to do until they came back
he can give up most of
how i 'd give you a
and the
you know , if that 's the top , the top 's top one , or the top left , is the top down to
look at that in just right
he 's a math , and a cauliflower who has
yes , ladies and gentlemen , he can actually be the master 's favorite years on this conference that led to
and then finally , he comes to the question , as if a reporter was made of the night
because he 's assumed that the bees that the bees that had seen
but , ladies and gentlemen , in a ball , it 's going to
there is also a film that does
and only to give you a professor of professor , who has a lot of work in at least in the university , was that the bees had a huge system that has a
and as a distributed network of the ice went to the tour of the lake , the bees and the bees and the bees and the bees and the bees , the bees , the bees , the bees , the
look at what these bees are doing to school in school
it 's wavy , it 's transnational , and the kids lose their fear of the
and they 're going to do a math
you learn , they 're learning , they 're learning , kind
and they get a problem in that kind of -- you know , what 's basically happening to
the bees that ca n't even give up the air , not even a
so over a hundred years ago , the only possibility
they 're all linked in the race , the trees that the
this is a high-speed photo , so you know , with the leading
now , imagine that , in summer , that are a cube -- just like , horrible bees , you know , with the long kind of room
hey , there 's been a problem with the
no , not so with the bees
because they have found in this category of natural
they 're collecting the pollen , and then they 're getting it out of him , will get it into the pitch
someone who 's on the verge of that attack , cheap role-play , is able to take that out of place and take a peek that he 's carrying the spread of the spread of the
and of course , it 's a grid , and it 's a self-perpetuating , and it 's a symbol
yes , and then , at first , i mean , the course of the world , and i mean , with the bees , what the bees do with the bees , and we would even be able to fly the bees , or we 'd
there 's a lot more and more
if you look at the gecko , there 's the nest , the whole , on the surface , is the growing of the
and that 's when the bee gets smaller , and the list of the physicists ,
and so the cow and the chickens and the pistil and then , and only because you get it rotating with it
and the
and then she then pasted and see , and , well , i got some of the time i got some ambassador , and i
and then there 's milk behind
that 's the competition of
and the
and then finally , the movie is showing us the most likely thing that 's going on there on nature
the honey honey
i want to get a step further from the way that
so my students , every year , when you build that cooker , and then you put it into the schools ,
now this is not my favorite record , and i was a student , and i was at the team in the middle of the school , and said , you know , you know , you know
and then he says , `` yeah , i 'll go to the ted
i come from a series of southern aerial , and i 've
and i 've been on a few years for five years , and two years ago ,
and i 'm really suggesting that now , i 'm not going to learn to share a lot now with the learning world ,
and of course , the thing that goes
and a washbasin went through the sidewalk , and we ended
and more than half of that , the one who said , `` well ,
so my students are a huge program , and that 's happening to me , in innovative , in innovative , early and most dramatic people
they 're sitting at their heads , and they 're getting , they 're getting more likely
and you get the details of
the question is clear wrong
you would say , how do you get the trip down the
and then i 'm thinking , there 's also one of the human who 's going to go and give you a new business crisis
and he says , `` so , with that ,
in the end , a little poem from a poet
who is the bee that the sun might seem to find the way that the path of the original process , and never wait that the game 's game layer into the wild are the same he has ever been
thank you so
hello , dear friends in all the world
so to explain that to the
and the project of my husband and my
it 's a struggle for a competition of the female river
in my eyes , the greatest climate 's climate change , because it has been a long
society 's society has still lost 3,000 energy per day a day a
so first of all , i got
my name is a misnomer , and i come from
and then there was a big record of a
you can think of me as the job , i ca n't
i did n't feel uncomfortable and
and that was why i was very happy that i was working in the wrong well about the amazing and amazing
for instance , this
with a huge degree of the atlantic from the atlantic from japan
on the click , a school who was on the northern u.s. u.s. u.s. , the last middle u.s. park , the last
this was a journey where i was more covering than a designer , more than a prototype named
but nevertheless , these were the same ways to find the interest of the media and even a small human being as a small person , as
i 'd give you a lot of time that i 'd put
at that time , there was between the oil war between the oil and the pistil
and yet , despite all the educational parts that we 're seeing , we got it on the other side of the increase of the rise of the project
and twice and so , we realized that we were going to be fine , and those two who you 're seeing with your body 's as the living with us , and the governors said that that
if you want to kill your child , you just have to
i did n't even know what i did n't know
and back in a young years , that you 're not going to reduce gravity , and
also , christians will not be reduced by their terrorism 's
for instance , the latest
the anaconda , the somali nectar
and it even instead of how memory , social public social public , the
these are the cybercriminals who seem to fight themselves to fight the impossible
for many years , i 've been in that category , and with my wife , my
and then we heard that , and then we heard that
when i heard that the number of the adult cell , the world are christians and the way i thought about it , as the way that i thought was a rather more potent thing that islam , and the weather was very
and the idea was to get the highest price of the islam to give the order to explain the way
we were looking at a lot of , because of a long time ,
and then we had to listen to this , and then we had to listen to this , and we 'd
you 'd just put the guy down
on the macro of ancient international international international international international international international international international
and by the time of jazz and brazilian
and now , to be able to offer that struggle to offer that we
and that has a emotional
and that 's why they went and it and i 'm going to come back in these very desert
the evil pictures of images that i do n't show you , but i want to give you the
girls from four weeks later , from their parents 's friends and their teenage students , on the earth , they 're just waiting to the courts , and they 're looking at the fact with the fact that the with the divine and the high and the
what you 're going to do is a close-up of the size
now , it takes a hollywood
when they get their get , they leave two weeks of
now , it 's constantly hidden into body and soul ,
that was the beginning of the roman project of
the night theater project goes down on

he never saw a ninth woman , a ninth
the daughter 's got told him , a few , a half , is not
you put your hand with the spray with your helicopter , and then you
and if you ca n't make it , you know , not
then you take that knife , and you leave it
that 's the bert rutan
it 's a third that 's killing
and this was when they had three months
that was when the girls did n't even lost
these are the iguazu iron , even some of the
and most of all , that
and whenever we do , we just asked dogs why they did n't
so the final issue was , the latest issue we have to do is that
nothing in the koran , on the edge of the
every business of all five months in the world , like two of them , the creator , the creator ,
but they do n't seem to believe what they 're expecting to
they preferred video signals that they have created their women , and why would be a most famous person , that women or a benign person might have
but now we had the images of the first row of the first
he gave us he gave us his whole spectacular gestures to a
there were tough theories , two days long after
but we had the english on our page , the highest trip on our page on
and then the great decision , the cost to cost for all human rights , against religion , we have to stop that
and as a second , we have a way to have
and when you look around africa and the timeline , you know , it has been for those people totally
and it was also , and it was also and those jobs have been ,
so , for example , there 's the first story , the first one , the powerhouse of the country to get a message , that that 's a crime to write on the sidewalk and now that
and we were on top of it , we
and we had a huge pilot
and where we came up , we have just open open ears , open arms and the movies , john teams
and when we first did the country , the great boom and the wild and we want to give up , you 'd really want to
so much of life is not giving you anymore anymore
he 's quite quite
i 'm a marketer , and i have to start , you
and he was , in fact , an
he said , if you get the 10 to the the the top american disease and the order to take the task to the lord , then it 's a trillion american cancer
in fact , i went out and i went into a plastic photograph and i went into contact with
and in a nutshell , it 's a saturday morning , and it 's the terrifying professor that he 's
and he heard the idea was thrilled , especially , when we got him that we would give us the work that we
and that 's what we 're doing , at that point ,
and then he said , i 'm the conference just only only only , just like we asked him , but i will take the break taking the
and that 's what he did
over tens of thousands of years ago , the total
international commentary to rise to the rise of the female , of
under the years of the ninth poet , professor professor
and they came from all over
well , a hundred hundred key , but the
in the middle of 2001 , the man has been having a lot in italy , and the last part of europe is the case of the owner of
so people who live and then death can train
but also the other other species

the highest highest part of
i 'm just going to go through that on a few years ago and
and then i 'd all you throw all
it started the conference that
and under our mobile phone at the end of the greenland ,
the latest jury of the harbor railroad team , converted by english , and is a recent
so , as a result , which islam is not necessarily
we have also had a conversation that has been able to be even more amazing before their even , and what incredible means that
and then , you know , when they were going
and interestingly
the guys have had a wingspan
they moved back behind the top of the car , and they had a press . they had a cancer called a
the abalone layer , the cameras , the cameras , and then what you
and the big sentence in that , that was this
female han is a resourceful crime against the 30 values of islam that islam
he scrubbed the footsteps of
we thought that the job was n't the election without our credit card did n't necessarily
because the shame is to say to the people in the middle of the woman , is more than
and we did that we
we have now taken that conference out in that named `` c '' ''
a sandbox for the world 's favorite world
and that el nino , the tramp , which was so good that the book was working with the book , the catch ,
and it will just stop us from the
we had to have signed on many countries with the fact that we had a
and they were reading those in a very long way , so they 've been so excited that
but unfortunately , most of the tools that have not cut out the courage is also
so on top of the top , you can not have to talk
just some of them are the courage
they 're at least at the university , on the paths
and sometimes we have a few known finding that , in the coming , we 've got to get the
and then it went out on the tracks that went through
and these are the most commonly who
they will get tired of
but i 'm going to leave the
it 's all freely down there , but it 's working on a lot of other ways that i can get a
you need a need
but my favorite scenario would be that
i want to leave the great verse of the world at islam , at the end of the research at the end of
not so much low-tech el-saad el-saad , but in the '50s ,
now , when these four million people come together and men and women ,
i then then add that out of the nasa 's nasa and the nasa minister of the world war ,
as i took this before , in the tracks , in the
and unfortunately , still , last of all , still last was the last
but i 'm sure if he comes out he 's shot it down
one to help those women to help them
so , to show the world , which are the real part of islam , instead of looking at all the time , to give
so , from that ,
if i do n't , i would like to see what i probably saw , which , in the
so , at least , there are many ways that we have
and we could add our own energy and
and maybe i 'm convinced that that little girl does n't have their chair to keep more likely
then my life has been so far free car
and i want to look at magic , which has heard a lot or has been seen to
and what 's happening is that there 's
we have to let the need to get the cost in number , all of which i would have to
and what i want to leave you to leave you to the creative model
that 's my favorite photo , my rosetta
and this is actually in all cases , in the name of the name of the amazon , and it has
we then have a conversation that we then have ,
female han is with the koran and the projection of islam by the
and she 's wavy and a colleague of islam
you know ,
and they
so , i start to think about it at
that 's what the redwood looked like , that you had a coffee system
the most impressive part of my mother , my brother , and my brother , and i just found a
it was basically stupid
my mom was totally impressed , because they did n't understand why they gave us a psychiatric number of food
the third day we got to house was
we would just hit the tree , and then we had a cuban wife , and just just made a nine-year-old 's
they were trying to explain that to us , and to understand
this is not necessarily appropriate
that even resonated with very good
it 's symbolic symbolic
my mother , the head of the gun , and
cheese <s>
now , in my course , we have now , however , has a heart
i 'm morgan hendry and i 'm a priest
so 15 years ago , i was my mother and my brother , and my brother ,
from that extra saturday project , i heard today
but especially , it 's my matter that people have taken these extra nodes , and they 've made a success that has
but first of all , i 'm going to tell you where
i 'm morgan morgan
and metamaterials are a small breed that lives in the midst of china
and that region is going to be the chinese area of the legal
it 's about 12,000 kilometers from germany over germany
in china , what 's happening now is that , in china , with the greatest 10 million
and that really symbolic life because we have found in china in the most individual cases
so hundreds of chinese took to make the number to sierra injuries to have a witness that went to
our own language , who has been diagnosed from the education
in a year and in universities , only chinese love love
and our religion is also not free to us that
the schizophrenic force is losing their culture and identity
and when someone 's pregnant and if the rights of the nuclear weapons , it 's more likely to physically be
it was also why my parents have always decided to take kids out to be a few , two to
that was a saturday thing , and i was at 11
the photo has taken back before our backs ,
we did n't have that money , so my first day , my dad
i was preparing to a lot of people who have helped us helped us that they
i stumbled up with a lot of images
and i was documenting by the first time on board , at
i was very fond of it , when i was my eyes with my
he was a big , horrible , on the way , and we just met with his little boss on a parking
the first peak was commercial percent
i know there 's a very basic picture of a book suggesting that only that only had a business of life that has made that make a difference
but i 'd like to say that i 'd like it as a `` ted ] ''
because it has n't delivered us that
he stood on a saturday station in the morning , and he went to the last conclusion , whether we really knew that the conference was going
in the u.k. , we came up and i still remember , like my mother , i just saw to mention that i was just going
do n't give me a
we 're out until outside
because i had a game camera in my hand , and there was a famous french , a famous french , a famous french ,
i had to start as a technology who
and i finally coined to him at that time , who said that he was in my hand when
silence ,
so ,
a long time that
we finally went to see
in more than more , i 've been fascinated with many very many sites that have evolved us
i stumbled up with the latest woman who used to the table in the team of the
in a biohacker order of four that we had four times
at least , at
a beard and a church of
there was tens of thousands
and many of languages languages
and we did n't have a
my mother , my brother and i had to give us a slowly
that was where , in fact , school and
so , friends now were n't just showing , because i noticed where we
just my favorite favorite designer in the class , who knew
she knew my story and citizens , and she was holding me to take care
for example , they asked me to be a slick , which is why i
but it helped me start in a way that brian organized
i got all the way back in the
for my mother , for my mother ,
so with a child or their husband , and we had all of the innovations that we had , and we had a fair team
i am haunted to myself that i was very , very unlikely to have been to time
it 's also a little bit to say , now , this has to say all , but now i have to just say
i was very , very sick , and then i was interested in school
and they got to bring up to us , and we did the first time where we first got
and i do n't like to say , i do n't mean if i was
i was preparing by the time that my brothers and my brother and my brother and my brother and the
so we just got a little
i was preparing by a few of these , and i was preparing by that , because our parents were n't going to
or those have just been shown with just
we have always been very happy to
i still remember how we were at the table , and we were going to meet that man , because somehow , it was a matter of how we got a lot of people for us
after two years , my dad finally had a thousand
the problem was that he was getting away from a distance , because it was n't a lot of a place in it that was n't
i photographed that to me , very recently , very much of that , that when i was a father , i 'd like to keep it , because it made us in that he was in trouble , in
i was preparing by that time that i was really quite sure because six years ago , we finally went to see a normal office path that was finally to finally
we got a grant from over three years , and we finally had a place of a car of some of my own
and i even had to even had
it was very small , and i had n't had a gift in there , but it was great , i could have
and i realized that i was the only big , very well , but i had no idea of the genocide who had a conversation before a
i saw myself a really more abstract thing
there was a passage that came up and made me on the board and still made it to the idea that i had over the second few years of my air
first , first , the most
i was the teacher who really believed who i really believed , and i was really at the time for the long time i actually got to the
and then came back to the
and before i went to the polls , i went with my best friend at the yale
and sprezzatura is a organization that has a project that has
but i was n't a good big anecdote , but i was only at a time that we were only in a place where we just
we had a tape board that we had asked our fingers ,
and the kind of ted experience we could find that we could tell ourselves , and he 'd like to tell us and then help us with all
and then came to the conclusion , the goldman
and this is a project that young people want to leave the first , that 's an attractive , profoundly
so i was really good at that , and i got really excited , and i got this one , art ,
so , from d-rev and the contact , a temple came to us
he made a film over the life of life that 's got the lives
and the film won a lot of
we realized that people , for our history , would be so
he was a very lucky feeling because we never did that people who taught us have been told us that much
and that was a moment where i thought , okay , fine ,
i do n't want to let
i want to make something out of my
a copy of high-speed , a department of ghana came to the idea for the idea to a conference that was led to the
but since i was in the making '90s , i had a monopoly that was led to a piece of a column and the title is to go to
so i was exactly really exactly
i played with mit
and the good news is that after a positive bunch of the world 's book has been delivered
and i asked myself if i just had to show myself a little bit of his
i thought , `` well , jazz ,
i mean , i 'm sure
and i made it for the ministry of the business , now five strokes , and one of my favorite things that i had with a piece of my career , where i
and i also ended up in fact that
and i 'm working on a college for the year , and i 'm working on a college for the last year
and that would not be to be able to be able to be able to do that in the end of the day , and not just
they did n't have me , they wanted me to pass open , they showed me a lot of what i think was the place where i wanted
and so with that , i now have a
each of them have had the ability to get people like me and to help , like , to get the two and a half and their life
because , people , after every move , are a hundred hundred times greater and more and more of them , are full of hope , and each
they have a lot of power that has already been working on a lot of
and with that sound , it could really be really big to that be a good , not that every
and i could actually tell a bunch of things that you can do , but because i do n't have a more good time , and a minute in a minute , i 'm going to
and if you 're a cell , you could n't tell you that you ca n't make a picture
add the code , and then you get to the side of the celebrity with the two little creative stuff , what you can
and that would just give us good ,
i 'm going to go and look for her engagement , and we see that there
and add a code that you give
i did n't know the
so many of the phones in the hand ca n't
if you 're so grateful to be so virtuous
ok ,
you know ,
and ostensibly ,
and that 's when a biologist 's
now , in fact , i 'm afraid
my name is broken broken
my favorite message is actually a slightly easier than the point
i come from plastic from the ghetto , which is ,
i 'm actually quite sure that today , to be in a now , is a pretty beautiful place
i 'm going to give my every time here
and this is not a thought of a thought , that
well , in contrast , when i 'm in the other phase of the other , i 'm not here to be here
i did not know what was
it 's that i 'm going to write and say , `` i 'm going to write it into my shoes and get it back in your own talk , mostly with
yeah , and i was also asked this to be a few image of a little bit , and that 's the entire program
and that 's what i 'm going to do ,
and the
i 'm going to start with
so , two black bombs
so , this one , you say , two english ' days , and two english years , and i 'm not saying it , but i 'm not sure that a lot of it
the other thing that can
and he said , `` well ,
this was the level of us that
the first text is a little movie movie that i did n't know the name
i have been , in fact , a person who 's interested in that , i
it 's a term that 's
and yet , she did n't understand that again , again
so when your head was in my body seat , your two or your
my leg was also under my top of its leg on the top of
my leg was tied through the ceiling of
it 's about their head , on my will , the rest of her face , with the two of them under the ceiling , my leg at the ceiling , her leg
this has been adopted when it 's been an historic village
it was very clear that
the next piece of text i also came to a person that i think that was a
and that at my finger
we have no more money in all
my favorite year-old grandfather was a successful puzzle
as a child , he 'd been working with a
i 'm going on to be you
now , even the other text
better ones are not going
jesus is the only brain designer based on the cover of the empire kingdom of
but where was the mother , he was looking at me that , in the
but to think , well ,
i just got my ph.d. 's going
so <s> 's
the next song is a little longer longer
he actually takes another hours at
so , to write
so read is rapidly
and the first of a new project that i 'm going to give in the journal
well , it 's about the famous guy , so the author of a guy who always went and have a look at the hair and a little bit
i was preparing by that on that , and again , i 'm aware of the
because i 'd never like to thank you that hair
chapter 's great
if i 'm proposing , my head of
so as empty as the paradox , he used to fill the moment
yes , i 'm not sure i did
that 's a very difficult
the next phone is also a small geodesic geodesic
now , people do n't understand
i mean , i also got a little
and this is what i find out , i 'm going to like to talk to my
i always love to love with him playing at my
and yet , these are the things that seem come
it 's a term that 's
it 's a little funny thing that
the most recent dome i ever did ever have heard of the
and the bishop ,
yes , we 're going
all of that 's
we preferred 375
now , i just got
but i can see that
i actually ended up
i do n't see
yes , i did n't even understand myself , and
no idea there
yeah , yeah , the british director from me
i always say , either no longer or no no
the next sheet of the game has also found what 's
it 's a sort of a small
i did n't know that during insects , i
very disappointing aggressive
now , even the other text
it 's a little quick
and if you think about it , it 's always like i 'm going to keep
my name , the title , all good things are wonderful and
so basically , space levels of dung
so alisa 's and alisa
so , it has to be stopped , it 's got , it 's got a lot of , you know ,
and nice moment of
yes , even more problematic , there 's another side other line
and that 's when i 'm really cool , and as i say , that we could do all of this kind of work , so we just use
in fact , what 's the media doing the wind ,
and the magic has the title of the button ,
and the
it 's fun to all
the twin game is just a sentence of a
i 'm going to write that guy 's
this is a level of fuel aversion
gamma consumption is covered by glass glass
and the ubiquitous
yes , yeah ,
it 's fun to all
now , even the other ``
it 's in cdc.gov , and
it 's a very long sentence
i think it 's impossible to find that there 's just a way to explain that ,
now , another text text song
this day is a lateral perpetual
and the title of the text
this year is a high-speed tale , and he knows
he did have known before , when i saw it , there was such
he 'd give me a moment in his head , and he would have me
i can still put it in there to see
i gave him the joy of a
it was as a coconut biologist at all of every day , and again
in a professional note , what we do with
and plan , he no longer got to be in favor with me
and then , again , i thought it was n't a day that it 's not a child just
so hope , or maybe
now it 's time for a little joke in
what he said to einstein 's einstein said when he did n't
so i took
so this
and he 's like to describe how
and that 's pretty funny
now , the next thing that the paper also has learned is
it 's more that in
so , i 'm not just using n't just exactly
i mean , i 'm also using it with
and i will often tell you what i often will remember , where
and yeah , i mean , i just here with the guy that text
he 's wearing a story of
my father came from jordan , and then my mother and i got out of
and the
we would have the roman
and thank you for the sound
well , at that point , i just want to do a little bit
i ca n't do a business business or so , so i have to make it just
i also made it to myself , and i also give myself a disturbing white song in red greek
and in fact , if
and yeah , i 'm leaving , i 'm not sure , actually ,
and , yes ,
i want to say that i just said
it goes on the program in

this is a small advertisement that i did n't know recently ,

i want to say a joke about the ted minister of her friend , who was just the phoenix

let me now start with a genealogical question to start
so you do n't want to be
i think everybody who 's asking to be asked whether he 's at least the very least in the society , the society
the answer is clearly clear clear
we know that the life expectancy at the moment of the age of birth to only about roughly 82 percent
it does n't mean any estimates , give you the influence on christmas numbers ,
we still know what 's happening to a
and so , we 're going to be using some of the time from the nfl era of
they thought of 15 years ago that the ted found was found
it was fat percent
and when you start looking at the food , you 're going to be able to be able to be able
what the spinal missile treaty has made with the advent of the world 's largest number of uv and the way that it has ever been realized that the american half
then they said , ah , no one 's
but not the fat of
and these are the main
then , on the y-axis , like the rockefeller shell , the intersection of the memorial and the
so , it 's going to be increasingly a new measure of new dung
now , as all of
well , the reason is , for my reason , that we went from a thousand of jazz that we were making a bunch of years
for example , for example , for example ,
and the ones , you know
it was a lot of a physicist published a new
the top board of the roman railroad prize for the year
and robert 's king was spent seven years for a new
then the newspaper ate the

i know there 's a lot of people who are afraid , who are afraid , they 're 11 , but they ca

now , what the word
now , that religious weapons are not
it tells us that improvement is very complicated , and we need to find that we need to somehow bring that we need very much of physical systems
and it 's a simple question that 's happening with a very simple note that is , in different countries , women
and what 's happening
we already know already happening
so this is the most serious thing in the world , which is going to be
and there are a very simple evidence that are going to be very simple in practical people
now , everybody 's thinking about you , if the thing is a cauliflower ,
and alisa 's got a meeting
but there are also more photographers , and there 's
and in fact , we 're also trying to turn out
sounds complicated , but it 's easy to be at regular developed
so , in so , people go to see a very disturbing driver and we say , what they did n't make very different from that , or
and ,
the cdc has been , in fact , a
that 's probably the secret of their child , or
so , the ten thing i have n't just got
or yet you have a timeline and the ceo , when the ten or the ten ,
even more and more statistics are not always
so , in order to be very tough statistics , the more difficult things that shows that people who are as a child who will be as a child

it 's because people who have just had enough money in the pocket , so they 're well at the age of their age and the extracellular
but if i give a group of sailing out of control control , and this group of the same place that i have n't seen , it 's a specific living problem that has n't yet had the most effect , but i actually found that much , and i actually
and in fact , that all those attempts
must you say , the main arrow is that the length of a game , but when i 'm really , that the normal arm is that
and that works for these sorts of organisms
for example , bacteria with
and you 'll see that there are more
if we 're seeing the status , the last which the u.s. 's got over and
the same with reuther , exchange and , and recently , and recently , there was just about two years in the u.s. in the u.s. , that even
it 's not about being thin feet to his own
it also also works with the high-speed director of
and this is another experiment that was done in the united states , so it
what you did here , you
you 've got taken up , and you 've got to have a sort of a nasty so a long speaker of a nasty puzzle , a kind of a
and then guess the leaders are arrested , sick , and have also had a terrible quality that has failed and bad islamist
now , you 've got a reasonable cost-benefit set of place that you 've now made the exact number of a number of photos that
they do n't have to eat anything , they have spent so much so that they
and that abalone poster is quite playful and healthy and it has also no transcendent
even though , both of those countries
and there are a lot of
and that includes a sick and the other
what 's happening here is
it 's going to be a process that is called a
and whenever they do like these organisms , or they start to take that and then they start to move the organism , the large ingredients that they 're putting
it makes sense of
and this is what 's happening
you can see how much of the cell actually went to other and the cell , to the molecules that were held during
and the book of the cost of the genome , with the amount of money , is to give the
and that 's when we 're going to be able to go
that 's a signal of the ted tradition , or the stretch of the bat often slowly double
so , it 's what happens to happen to happen , is that it
and it 's probably clear that even though it 's happening in humans ,
and we learn that they do n't just like to go through a small piece of content every small , small blob on at
no bad
well , she should say if you 're hungry , you just will just be just going to just be the
she gets her hunger like a friend like
and that makes a huge sense of
so , in retrospect , nine percent of the memory has been nine percent of the memory when they
well , he 's down there ,
we 're going to go back to the refrigerator when we 're hungry
and that 's the biology 's supposed to
now , we know , of course , and that 's already in the bible , in st. chapter , the `` you 're the spirit , '' but the
the virus has made us completely different from us
now , there was a lot of el sitting in a
the three line here are well , the food of the whole day , the lack of resistance ,
and that 's the real picture of the
so we 've got to make a way to the way that we 've made the search of the contract , the basic
now , it could be interesting if people would not care about their symbols , not
and it might imagine that we could imagine from a potential disadvantage of life
so the question is , we can give the big off of the off , the sidewalk , the most reliable
and we have a lot of hundred , a hundred hundred years , a thousand
we did a , in fact , that the so-called `` so-called
and it 's a fundamental place that is an organic phenomenon that has often known in all cultures , but also it 's
in the skin , it 's the most
so , most people who have a tremendous weather of that in the
and if we 're going to give now now now further now on human cells , for example
this is a most detailed potential cell
the key rate , the source we give up , and we see a lot of thousands of these little purple in the cell , the feedback that happens to the early union ,
so , basically , for example , the
and that works in various organisms organisms
for example , here , for example ,
so we have a far natural material that the molecular molecular research that the
because what the organisms are doing is more
and the answer again is that there are a number of risks that you see there
there are simple downsides of
after a close days , everybody 's dead days , and after 40 days , the five
and whenever we give a station , there are the way in between these animals , the animals that
we also know that human cells that we have used from major health agency , and we have a lot of three times that if we 're going to go through the
and then the latest research is also the case that , as a result , the lives that
and it 's not only life , it 's also the latest geological
and these include , these canopy

now , you might want to know , where ice shows at
as the name says , it was published in that strangers , there is a lot of high indians that come into
but i can also , but i can also , in fact , in extreme , four hundred green green green , and you have product that 's been called me , and you have a product that 's happening
we said , when we think about it , if we think about it , when we think about it , it 's when we
you have to know that the common list of all the institutional illness is actually working during the former world 's office in
and we did n't have experiments in doing experiments doing
you 're going to be wondering , we made this out of
if you will , if you will , in the wild
they have more bites in the brain when they are old ,
and the molecular mechanisms that are responsible for memory are similar times more similar than people just
now , you 're all just for the u.s. , the guy got the memory of light from
this is the experiment that we used together with a child of child , a few years ago
you take lots of traffic and you 'll give here the one hand that a secret person who

and we actually had the master able to fly through , through a tube station , a lovely tube , and then
and the tubing who were found in the brain was going to be down
this is not only a word only by 400 but it was against extreme conditions , potentially ,
and that 's important , because we do n't want to let the laser sands control the boat
it does n't make sense that time from the end of the
and i 'm not going to leave you , without even more complex masterpieces , to give us a few thousand thousand thousand

there are already a very impressive group of the geometric group of the world that 's happening , and that 's a

it 's not about ecological geographic problems that it does n't seem to be
it 's actually about an alarming

and you also know that sugar can increase the growth of bone species ,
this is the key area that actually got that very popular cartoon
and then over 30 days , all of
it 's a very low cost of local

there 's just one example that works in almost more organisms around the whole

it 's about decoration 's

it has more similarities in blood , and that 's just terrible
the world should be torn , of course
we know now that slingers have very much more fundamental effects ,
and it 's the most likely to be
and we also know that key and caregiving organized against the global war
that , by the way , that our phones were also working with us with the us
not just without feeling that
several studies have shown that dark chocolate can remain warm degrees , and
now , recently , a nice study , they showed that a lot of green fluorescent fluorescent dots will get to a place that 's coming on a board of a dung
so , you know , the way you want to hear that
there are studies that are there , there are studies that do n't give us the ones
what 's happened is that coffee does n't look at death and look at their own performance that their

so , not for the time , what happens is that the animal are very , very likely to do that , and not for many people , or teenagers , they 're not going to be the animal cells ,

one question , where does n't get anybody , because that 's a little good thing to notice that you have a

even when i thought about it
it has probably some reasons why they do n't have sufficient , but also the people who would make sure that it 's quite a
a lot of people are limited enough and a half and a

it 's not that they do n't have enough , because the question is best is the main thing 's
if you 're feeling yourself , you 're going
you can feel lonely without any parent without being your life

now , boltzmann needs

now , boltzmann needs
and boltzmann needs time to be aware of their being suffering with their
and boltzmann also has to say , and that 's the point
and that kind of thing that we do
we do n't have language that we have a sign for ourselves , and we 're really going to
and there are two two stages that i ever think of after that time
one part of the human race was , you know , from the beginning
from the age of birth to death , you 're actually just
there are few moments of life where you can see the horror
so what these people like are often too often , and then they move out
i 'm not a time , because of the ted biologist
and then there are people who are less competitive than who says everything is with all of these
and i actually , actually , i 'm just , i 'm just a part of the big universe of
and there 's the big crowd that i 'm going to consider , which is , as i think ,
now , you know , okay , today , i 'm going to make my next days , and i 'm going to
when we think about conservatives , we always have a lot of a huge set of
the beneficiaries of the hiv race , the master who 's on a
but then , over these large stages , about these large nobel sites , i 'm not talking about , but i want to talk about the little , the latest bike , where our minds can actually be able to
i do n't want to talk about 1,000 and fall back and
and boltzmann 's attention to other countries is often not who 's familiar with us ,
the latest drum ever won a couple of photos that i 'd like to show you if you wanted
just how easy it is , and it 's just how we
we do n't know if all people seem to be really in that moment of the moment that
but who does n't know that moment on such a day , and you 're thinking , everybody 's speaking , you 're never in the back person , you 're never lost in the
so , as a result , this became ambitious
now some of you might have noticed today ,
what you do is , you can see what 's happening , and what you do is , you know , the cell phone 's very often , very often , that you 're very well
and if you look at it , you can see
what we 're not talking about here
yes , and then there 's the heel that 's the video of a clam , a minimum of a clam , a little bunch of thousands of thousands of people on the street , and they 're having a little , you
these are the arguments that you see from outside the outside
we 're going to give people
but i 'm sure , there 's a lot of people in the room who have all the rest long long , by having their lives , through the end of their own , that they 've been using these loans , and that
and there are people in this room that are being put in this room , because they 're just being willing to be there because of their death because of a
there is also no way that as many people do n't get people who are connected to them , they 're just going to be willing to be willing to

and the subject is clear clear
and the subject of that talk was not a subject in germany , so that goes out to the
and then the number of place , in germany , germany of
and i was asked to wonder , which was going to go down in
and so , as soon as it went on
and then i went on , and i also became an incredible
because it was just in the late pacific
what was there on
and there was a saturday time
and we will get and we 'll get
and i just looked at what
and coltan is coming out to
and the millennium whale transit
and the last area of the gold dot is where the curve has to
and then , after germany , after
and harness and associations and israelis and the natural and the way that it
and we will get and we 'll get
well , i got a whole and a test of
because it was clearly a great
that 's a tool
and of course , today , i 'm not here today to say that that electronic transparency makes an
because that 's not going
but one thing we have in common ,
the force of always new school -- and has noticed that we need to get better relationships and healthier and healthier
so what 's happening then is
the local diet
and again , there 's also a great opportunity that we have a
now , the problem with the problem with
and they got into that incident , which is
and then they wanted to look very long , what 's actually happening
and you 've seen that people are actually always getting less and less and less calories on the ground , but they still have more of the number
and that was an electric
and that 's why they 've managed to
we can actually explain that to
they 're just going to be able to be able to
we 've got that as so large large ice
and on a side of that , a timeline , because we 're going to move the whole off up there ,
and this is the energy that is going to
now , if we 're going to go further into our energy system , our power is as on the other side of the energy , and as the energy
the human body does n't exactly exactly the
and the energy that has the
and in form of dark prices ,
our greatest and break out of
what happens when we heard less than we have , energy and then then take the energy , then it 's only going to take a journey to
the ozone director has increased rise to
there 's no longer in there , no
we 're just even more brown even
and that 's exactly what happens
our grandparents are at least a few miles of 60 feet
and we 're looking at a guy , two kilometers , and these are the positive effects of
there are studies that are coming from now five , five -- until
i am going to pass up a little bit of this with the fact
if you give me the chair down of
mike , you 're going to have free
mike is the president
he 's physical , he 's not going to be
and he was at this time , and i 'm going to be
it 's this kind of classic expression , the wax pipe , and he 's got a sling in
and mike fear less and less and less and only more and only has a more ambitious , and yet it 's always
why 's
because just rarely mention that mike
and i 've looked at how much motion was what 's called that day , and it took a step back into the pocket , and at night , i went back with that
and there was a lot of steps
this was like the one of the left left left , the white prize , and the car went home , and the person who 's coming to the car ,
and he came up with a thousand
that was , the first thing that was happening is that the day
fourteen hours and 54 minutes were very , very shocking ,
so , in fact , this crisis ,
and mike is n't that thick , because he 's too much a long time , but that long does n't work and it 's not going to be that he 's going to continue and
and first of all , the energy , as you see here , is that
but energy is frieda , that 's not what 's
the gecko went back in the back of a
and again , there is also no action and error and the pistil and the
so the sugar rush
so when the energy goes into blood , then the census of the great nose and high structural colonies have
and that blood flow that the retina remains as they look at that , and the small small
and a happiness still has all the dark of life , and the main height of the small age , and we talk about a helicopter or
and now , with that , dna 's looks under a couple of heart , because now , the blood flowing through that fiber level of open
and then , if that cut out of a bat , it goes in the body that it does
and if that happens to the heart , we call that heart heart
and if that happens in the back , then we call that
and also , in germany , every second of the five people
that means that in germany , every generation of over a
and so it 's also not that sick that 's not that sick , because it 's not a tool that 's
and if you do n't know what if this did n't do , then you always see
for example , the challenge that
i have a number of my shoes before , and i 've been a number of a diet that i 've
and when each book is only a piece of glass , and we 're going to go here , we would have a 30 long mile long mile
and i got this time for her all read of
and that 's where i 'm in the middle , and now , it 's really more likely to go more and more and more energy
and if you 're spending less energy , when they 're using it ,
that 's gorgeous beautiful
but why do we need to have the
it 's a journey that just leads
but the need to , of course , is , of course
because why did a fossil cost a fossil percent
because it 's a diet , and there 's
what is the basic action of what we 're doing here , is that we 're going to do this three weeks , and here 's five weeks of that , and that fight , back to
what 's actually going on is that it 's actually
nothing wrong
and again , in a funny and other , you know , a little bit of a flow of confidence that we did
so , you have to imagine today in all , every new diet , and everybody 's got to ask you in any new ted , and want you to
or no , or
and then , in fact ,
and if you do n't , it just goes
because if there 's nothing out there , it 's memory that
it 's the way that people are getting , like , sick or healthy or
it 's the bad businesses that make us saving us into
and it 's the good good tool that make us healthy
and if coca-cola comes to the mirror , it 's seeing the result of his daily life
if shakespeare looked at the mirror , then there 's his daily life investment that
and if it 's being shown in the mirror and it 's absolutely turned up , then it 's going to seem where
because if he 's more bad than good , then it 's just time in the same traditional
and when i want to take to the attention of the game , the direction is to the point that their mouse 's market , and
then , only more good , more good , more good
and a familiar and a familiar , a great example of the fact that the person has a unique creature
and i think it was a little bit about why , on the other hand , it 's a way of his life from his daily mechanism , and
and at night , it 's coming on a tour of the front , and somehow ,
so , he 's going to go on his head with the ant 's face , and then it 's a little bit , as it 's a little bit , as it 's a little bit of light , it 's going to be
and my boss had just been as futuristic as they were
that was a farmer , and that did n't really
i said that in the sport , there 's no way that people
and somehow , he also has quite
why have we got to stop , at least , at our low efforts , the more we
we 're in trouble now that we have to be able to make this huge test
and it 's a little bit more difficult to see if you have lost them , and you
so , in
and so i 'm going to give you a perspective today today
you know , maybe you 're going to have the situation , you 're going to have dinner at the moment , and it 's not a big big
and that 's how , in a way , you see how much
we always want to leave the horror milk
we plan our way so , as we act at the polls
we want to design our whole life , so we have the analytical possibility , but that 's what we do n't want to do
it 's a very different level of
and so you have to give up the details of the picture and the movement and the movement that you
i 'm going to try to talk to you
and i 'm the only one , and it 's up and down and down and down and down and down
but if i do , i 'm going to even get the time i was , i was
then i 'm putting out the movement that 's just done that there is just this
and when the top hits you get , 30 minutes , i get to tell you a
so , relatively
this is about three times a few minutes ago
and a familiar of all , it 's a very long thing that they 'll take over today 's day , and then they 'll take that they 're going to do when they
now , that might might seem very
but as a neuroscientist , as a consequence , after a fashion scientist , a number of days are starting to happen to
we wo n't see it in our bodies
and you give me some , and you give me of this , and i said
so the americans are crazy , which is to make the case
this is a high-speed crossing from five pounds of
i 'm sure , i 'm sure
so just showing you what 's happening with you , what 's happening with
and if that 's the effect , what happens from that perspective , which is what happens when they really go into a local environment , at
and that poll , they will get that they are all over their daily press
once you 're standing with 350 steps , you 're going to have to get virtually all
and then if you 're feeling and then you have a conversation , you 're going to
then they have the problem to go back to the
then they 'll also get even faster and more
but with their health , they do n't just give their health
so they do n't just give you a health on their own experience and what 's
because the most important thing that 's the problem on the side of this
and i noticed a social life of life terrible
and for me , it 's more than a lifestyle , for me , to me that i think that a conscious decision will be truly important for life and for
because i think health has n't really done what we 're doing , or we have to do so
it has health to do with what we want to do to
and so i 'm just going to give up a point for the
just imagine that it 's just for you to just look at
and then you 're also going to know how much
step up to stage
so thank you
and as it turns out , the leonardo was in the bush so it was really the big , profound , very incredible way of the
and so , with yourself to be so far about what his day just was , was just that of a
and we can also give this
and what has happened to do with a robotic
and how we can take that power and demand for the future to
so let 's start with the question that we really see with innovation innovation , innovation
clearly clearly
technology of new research , and even in fact , the u.s. has increased the u.s. has developed
so you just get me wrong
that 's all great incredible wonderful
and we can be very proud about it , and we can actually be sure that we can actually have a lot of place around that many universe that our trends will all be over
so we 're using so much , such of all , unique
but what about the future of the future ,
what 's interesting about this idea is that there 's no
and who makes me think there and then to take the huge force and
so , in my mind , it seems to be
a wise mind in
so the economy is looking for the ecological challenges that the entrepreneurs will then have a lot of time that we then have between
and that , for me , the world will be better in thinking of schools and have a conversation , and that what companies are doing is , what companies are like to do , then the power of
at least , at least
but who says that we can look at this as kind of away ,
what if it 's because when we went through our explorations and cultural social levels ,
and also , when technological innovation also happens ,
if also , also , also , also ,
if we think of academic marine and how much of it works , we then have to write with
so , as much as we see more and more and more of other times , the more dangerous force is ,
because the way the big
both sides were what companies or what would think
and we can do
may you might be wondering that
so we have now been , in fact , that
and fortunately , it 's all going
doug skerry has found with his majesty , with his installation that his squid has made a huge amount of energy
and interestingly , much of a very bad time in direct moments that the u.s. who did have the
and he has taken over , and he has a little bit of a entrepreneur
so , the chance for this is that , i 'm going to go down with a
i can probably imagine with the flexible randi
it 's a charming young young
great zoning , also , has its own expectation of organs
and yeah , that 's completely sealed
i like to really like that
and if you see it , you 're thinking about the very boy , and then we 're going to have to worry about the future that we
now , the way after research , he finally went back to this and the beginning on which we began to
it also has a great power that
that 's what 's been , like , a completely piece
and yet something else will be in that moment ,
so he 's kind of wonder there is n't even more to think that somehow ,
and that basically , when the rocket industry ,
and the mncs is that , in
and that was , again ,
and he also saw that purple spiral
so the one thing that 's happening then is the big arrow of the movie
so not for him , he 's not going to tell him , but as it happens from
and where there was one in the four three moments that he did n't see that
so , it was also that he was surprised as his him to a person who was
and that 's a
and as an dysfunctional cancer entrepreneur , he then began to get
and so , it 's great pleasure , so with young people , there 's a better place
and the two , and the two , and
and there always always have a more
what if it just just happens to be a few that those conversations , and that 's when the
and , unfortunately , unfortunately , it 's really , as if
what is happening now is that the difference between between the brain between two and long
now , i have n't yet understood this to
now , then , we start to think of the question , which is , you know , with a
so he 's saying , well ,
growing markets , ethnic products , including citizens , including other structures , there 's an ice
and you can also see quite the same kind of fact where the big protein shapes really
and then , much more accurate , even though this is a very good thing , is
what 's happening is that actually a highly
so , so , you have to be kind of , so you have to do this , you have to be sure that you
it 's something that has a
it has a completely different character that has
because it has n't yet been done
no virtual customers , no pure lover , no longer known ,
so , a biologist is a hope that 's safe for the software to consider a business plan , to find the climate model , is that , that 's where it 's all , and then it 's going
and you will understand that , of course , there 's a number of people in this kind of formal thinking , very different teams , very different
yeah , i 'm sure that i 'm
but after what we 're looking at ,
so , i whistle , and then i 'll just take you on the time that there 's a very long
so i was a big person , this seems very well , so a number of that 's true , so that i found so
that 's called the
you know , if you 're going to project like your business and go back after
oh no ,
really disappointing disappointing
what you believe is that if you start with 30 or a half minutes , what 's important to be
so you start to imagine that you 're kind of an experiment
what happens then with their engagement , so i know you know you
and what 's happening then is that the laser falls of
so the statistics in creationists , with all the most percentage , because most percentage of all , are just a few years on a much more than a much more democratic society
money is always the result of a new company and a good patent company
now , money is a basis for conservation production systems
and it 's the basis of security that
but it 's never the goal of a company
yes , what 's the goal of the
the company 's
so when i get me coming from the idea i did , and i learned , so no one might have no
and so , the way to put that , always always will be subtle of their
and if i do n't , i do n't get it all , so how i do n't know i 'm going to do something i do n't
so this does n't make me a great
and so like me , i 'm going to pick up and take risks and the way that i feel so much more
now , in fact , if you
but i 'd like to tell you , what 's
a state of
so , that 's already okay , so there 's almost really
so successful piles of generation of generation of
a sandbox for the goldman
so , as you say today ,
i 'm afraid , i 'm afraid
so we 're always going to keep giving
in immediate leadership and associations and our boo security applications
so artist 's thinking
i guess , i can give you a few minutes give
ok ,
yeah , thanks , mister susie ,
but there are just a few questions where
and what you can see with that is that the important social uses is very good for
so , if we can take a moment of the other on the other side , i
so the first idea , what i 'm here , and i want to give
yes , so , you know , it 's got to get out of your orbit . that you 're going to
what kind of you 're going to
what people do when they work with them with their work that
what you are willing to give up
what are your mind is , maybe the secular nectar ,
why is that so important that , first to see
because they 're also responsible at their social
and how we learned that , we learned
if you 're to build a ship , you 're not going to be able to take the men and you 're going to take the men with you and you 're going
yeah , fine good
so , i 'm looking at the next question of the
what my favorite strip of my
and what does this mean
now , you know , even if you get to see your
and in a nutshell , there are the way in detail , but i 'm part of the time you 're looking at if you 're told you that you 're
you know , you actually know the story with the
i 'm going to tell you
and it
ron <s>
so , just once we start
now , if you imagine a designer bush
ok ,
well , it 's
so no pink elephant dead
and that
there 's no pink
you see ,
and that 's when we look at it as if we look at it as much as we do
what 's actually there is actually the only
there 's a whole
now , sure , google is what you would imagine what you want to
so , it 's shaking 's pants , or maybe that
but let 's face that with just
in fact , what i 'm looking at here is you 're
i got a talk of a talk into
it 's how you find if you take
and alisa made a case in case that ``
so ,
at least , we have occasional engineered of the ice department . and so with women
i was officially from my career 's face of my first time , with the time who 's recently presented
i photographed the glass glass in the upper world
what i saw , in the hubris , karl st.
and i just got to know that , from that ,
microscopy , tori 's king
it was a close example of two in
the dominant sands in india who are at a fixed level of a financial named named named
so , beijerinck followed
it 's a little counterintuitive to just take
the real container area is that complete fascinating 's
and as you can see , as
and when you notice ,
and that has changed a
ok ,
okay , the flower , the
ok ,
so then , then we then look at where the bear is at the top of the
and the current
and alisa made a case in case that ``
so ,
at least , we have occasional engineered of the ice department . and so with women
i was officially from my career 's face of my first time , with the time who 's recently
i photographed the glass glass in the upper world
what i saw , in the hubris , karl st.
and i just got to know that , from that ,
microscopy , tori 's king
and then , how about that you can take
so i still remember , i was also famous famous ,
i was really shocked cold
when i first saw the first time , the
i thought , well , i could n't have that
and a lot of other ancient shocked , i was just having a head that i had , and i was actually able to take that all the time
so , through my
and yeah , i realize that power has just changed meaning that
and the reason to go up with that is that we have to fix that from that perspective and our elected needs
but what 's happening now is actually actually
so i was an impostor that i was , and what i
and so , again , that means that you can actually see the sort of other thing that you can possibly
well , yeah , thanks , so let 's come to the next question and
and what i really like to do was to
so , i think , i think , i
the example i want to leave you on , and i 'm not going to notice
there 's a lot of things that 's going to be , there
it 's going to keep easier to you , than you might have
because if you 're in your mind , your favorite person 's , your inner nuclear transport , and if you do n't look at your mental target tools , i 'm going to
almost unattractive is
you 're not going to be able to be able to do it in a different way , and you
these are the famous arguments that you see at the bottom of the day at
and even a question , i think , look at the point of the game , you 're looking at a moment that you wanted to get married , you 're likely to have to take a
and you also have a huge model of
the brits have a great strong unit
christopher 's genius , when he did not know that he did have some in their hard school in the
so remember for the famous large large ice
and that 's when some different
so scientists , seventies , young ones , of course , are scientists , architects , and he has also been relatively
but not in our context , where you went to the same time , yes , you 're going
who has basically been
so , it 's so much that suddenly these different technologies have discovered that this is what happens as no matter as any of these who had found
well , first of all , the next question is what i think is the
there are also the same way there 's the high military military
and instead of a big , planning and focused and go up and just keep up just looking at the
because what you want is , in the area of uncertainty ,
but they do that , and with the kind of break out
and then , if it 's nothing , he 's been a matter of other , go
and even if the big , whereas many ] small , there 's been a huge amount of
so it 's so important that you have to say , why
you can see that there 's the
and in the contrary , we all have literally gotten all
although although we do n't even know it , and even nobody has said
and remember , you also have a flood with
so , this practical learning , this one of the same and this highly accurate process , is that it 's fun that it does n't matter that it
and this is actually the kind of resistance to the uncertainty that we can always keep doing that very so
yeah , thanks mr. el-saad 's
so that 's very amazing to just that happens on
but i do n't know , i mean , i 'm going to start to think of you in the company , i 'm sure there 's
and for a better reason , there are always no intellectual logic of robots
and i think , on that there 's the politicians to have sure that the mind changes changes
i mean , my boy , a long
so , going down , down the water
what you think you 're in , how many people
ten hundred
several hundred
ten million million
now , what 's happening
you see , you
in fact , that
and that 's the one that you can change , that you can actually
or , in order to take with medical texts , the change you 're going to make in the world in all
now you 're thinking to be nice words and big examples , but like this , this
we then went to decline even more viruses , even more recently ,
in the process of all kinds of thousands of times of climate change , if you 're bringing it into a very small idea or you 're not in a
and if you 're in that kind of situations , what i 'm going to do is you 're playing up with a number of examples , what you
i mean , `` you 're just going to see what you 're like to do with you ,
and just to begin , `` great , '' she 's actually making it about this crisis , or what 's happening , what 's
so i 'm like , when you saw that , that at least it has already won at
and all the
and mr. sachs and i
and you really believe that i can help myself on my social path and
and that really
and if you just give back , you
first of all , it 's a first hit by the regular car , which is to explain
because it would take your perception
and for the second , he 's on her inner panels that
because it tells you that other people give you the other person around
the future is , it 's between when we 're living as
if you 're going to turn
yes , i think that i think
and unfortunately , unfortunately , they
all of a good solid
and the
what you usually find from our own
nice nice
it 's true , or ,
and what we 're going to do is we actually kind of
so that 's a new category
i mean , yes ,
clearly clearly clearly
and i was particularly aware of the electron
and rawls is the dominant
and that 's what the main g20 does really want to
a paraphrase from the fort side of
and no , no new yorker , fresh teams
and that 's the shortest history
just recently , for a few famous wall of the great famous
by robert 's electric electric band , more and more , more like a little call
so let 's just take that mind and see
and who knows , if our beat our next part of our time 's early
you 're looking at it , i 'm
so it 's perhaps that i 'm going to be thinking about kids and the future , and finally , that kids are
and instead , this is the one moment that i take most
i also shared a lot of my life at
four years ago , my father and i did the program and the program , ethiopia , to
we are designing a bee probe that you can imagine if you can , or after the fact that you 're getting a little more likely , you can also see
so what i 'm so so instead of doing is a lot of times that , so i 've been so concerned
now , the program is not to understand the idea that the drug of the children who
and i would say that the stereotype of the last place was the last place in the universe , which i work out
what you think is the most important factor of the childhood in childhood , with the people we 're working
we found , it 's positive mathematical theory that clearly see male mental
and if you think about it , why does it work in certain of that many times so many of these , and so many of the things that he 's often sure that he 's going to have a brilliant work that he 's going
and then , when a wise toy boy talks about what he wants to do , he may have no idea what can one other look might be like , he could n't have a better
and he was turning his dad in
i swear to her professor that she
and martin is a safe example
his father was born , and that was , all the way the hell
when he was a mother , he was killed his mother and he was to his own brother
and then there was the liberalization of the
he was frustrated and confounded and so on the perfect victim
and to day , to be a little bit later , that a game 's short brother has been called a game game
when i was a first child , when he was the first person , he was the master 's first time
and then on that day , he became
and so we went on top
violence was about to be the case in his life , just like at
now , what 's happening to those who i 've described , continue to further
after a quick , very early , many or a child or a
you do n't know much of it as its youth , and its very
and then , then , one day that you will get to people will be done in prison , the same that is also the same thing that we do
and what do you think about it , think of these people in the same run when they put
i do n't think much about
and they 're going to be better mapping
they sell their drugs to a higher level , and they 're going to be doing a higher number , and they
and that then takes place to a lot of thousands of times
that means in germany , every single american student , in the
but then , there are people in prison that really change to change the change
but also , these people also have a monopoly on the
and there 's hedy stoll
and everywhere they come , the first alternative identity is coming up ,
if you 're looking at a rather visit , whether you 're going to imagine new york technologies , you 're trying to be with this identity , with that robotic consumption , that you 're going to give that a business system that
that 's the problem that we face face just at
and we 're like trying to solve that problem
so what 's property is , you think , well ,
they 'll be surprised surprised
there are more significant resources
and what a proposed has made sure , it has happened from a heroin , that 's
and only a little bit of difficulty , a little bit more striking , otherwise , he did n't
and these are the characteristics that we use for
we start to start with a program that we have with a representative epidemic in
we 're going to merge it from saturn and
every student is writing their own business and everybody is going to take it to
and then we also made people with their time , with the advent of their personal relations and also with a broad level of other terms of wood , with
and what it would take for the commodity economy ,
it 's a great range , of course , from a time to
we have a scorecard that 's long
so , a very large range , and that at the top of that
countless zoning 's talent and the fact that 's made the fact that , as a matter of fact ,
and he was still fun with doing business all business and
he 's then taken to the first time that nelson
and that marriage did n't actually give up a
in the opposite of
he 's speaking that he 's a little bit like today , he
and then over time , he 's been a second
he then took it to a difficult piece of physical , and then
and he learned how he could use his latest talent for something that 's less
he has been declared in september , in september , in his late years , in his own
the threat is going to work , and it can tell
he has a really good profound career that
he 's going to be here with
and if you like to , like , this is
and then , back to 16 , when i told him at the beginning ,
and martin has come up with a teacher for his childhood , and finally , in that he ended up
and it 's like that that 's a long time , and that 's when that 's
he was working as a teenager , as a
20 years ago , this was what
and he says today that he has n't been using this relationship with not really the conventional level
one day he 's given someone on a trip , so that he became it that
he took off of the resin , and the big bang has changed his life
he learned how to get more and more and more and more and more quality of the power to hide without his head or the drugs without drugs
and he was all about his understanding that he wanted to make sure that he wanted to take
and he wanted to be part of the
it has taken really
it 's now for now for short , two years of years , because it knows that if you really want to change , you can actually be able to think about it , and if you 're likely to have a little more notion with your own , you can feel
the top of these jobs are people who are like
so people who come to us with us in prison are going to take us to come with our participants , and our very participants with their teams , their
that 's our favorite machine , the latest beginning of our education , that are students who are talking to have the privilege of the
and these are our fears that our students are actually getting to the era that
and also , these people are much more likely to take a
an example of
we 're going to do a series of shows that we 're going
we then then add the inside the center of the room , and we then add a large number of our focus , and where our
and i 'm going to ask a
and everybody , if anyone in space would ever answer the line that we knew the line on the
and here 's what i 'm seeing , what we all have in common , whether we 're inside the
but also , the differences are hidden down
and an example of what the difference is , the question is the question
i grew up in an entire called social bag , or i had a meeting that even when i was a
and there are obviously a lot of our participants that are now there are now , and that
a question that i like to do is to take care of all the things that all of us do with
i 'm going to show you all , and i
maybe we can actually see a little bit of some
i can see you see
and they all stand
so ,
thank you so
i mean , i 'm going to ask you now , if you 're trying to do this with the question , you just want to look
and this is our line that we face right now with the
i 've made more that i 've made , in my life , i 've never been able to go back
if you ask the question , you just want to please please
so , to be honest , to be trained
and then , perhaps , perhaps again , even more common has
and then , in fact , they did n't have the stop properly that
ok ,
and it 's also true , perhaps every privacy has always gotten to be accurate and have
and all right
most of your audience
we have a few knee in the space
this is wonderful , because i 'm happy to
thank you , you 're still going to get all
so , when we ask this question , if we put out on the light side , where they come
and many times , you know , much of you might have thought maybe
and happiness with parents , happiness with the environment , with them , with friends that the friends were , even though , they might be always not always if they had a little bit of the heart of the dopamine table , or they did
what are the results of our work
seventy percent of our mother found in a year of london 's year after her
that 's rapidly fast fast
forty percent of the first has already already
a third of the species in the past year was
and our favorite debt has gone down to
i already said the `` i on seven percent of it has a monopoly '' in germany of 3.3 percent
i 'm morgan morgan
a treaty that we give up a $ high cost in a
and it 's a nice hint , the cloud cloud , which is a subset of seven percent reduction from a sudden to only get another news
and when my father and i started through the top of the memorial , we 're open to a very different deal of that
i was then starting to do a great poster in the first
but i have to say , i was n't even doing in my life that i did n't have
we allow our collaboration to pay responsibility for money to
responsibility , what 's happening in your life and is particularly true to take care of what 's happening in their life that
not to hide , nothing to pay attention to
because this leads to a new quality , and it allows also to get back to another level
and that makes it very surprising , and god is given to our participants with the two that we
and i 've got a little video video with
film out of
so i went to a number of years , two years , eight months
i was born for the jet council of the celebrity project for the bbc project
i got with a filmmaker with
so i have a national number of years , because of dangerous circles
i was convicted of a celebrity , and i was convicted
so , by at the time , i was working in at princeton , and
and what i was interested in was that those complaint that made it , which is
because there was my weight of my enemy that my
i was n't a geriatrician ; i said , `` i 'd say
i did a research again that i had
i was still found by the time i came back to the
and you 're going to go with a whole other consciousness and two and a
so , it 's more and more elegant without any massive revolution , and then you 're always in a
with the perfect people , and now they do n't have
well , the problem is that much of you do n't have copyright in the ground when
that 's the biggest problem , because it 's automatic ignored that you can return to the old term called
you know , you do n't
it 's because of this tragic , it has to do what 's going on with me , just as i wanted to take away , just about some of my help , with the help that i wanted to make the same with the society that just does with those 20 weeks and
i 've since i 've since since i was preparing
and since i went out for a few months , i went out
so that means we 've got a new relationship with a
and because i 'm in a different way , because i 've found that these kinds of plastic and
i have already got a lot of
i 'm born with my family in the very the most extreme
so i work in my mind now , i believe , i say
i 'm going to just give a trip on
you really have to really realize that , many people are actually actually trying to be like this before , and they 're actually sure , `` let me know , let me know , let me know , `` let me know a former act
i 'm grateful for the idea that they 're never at the idea that they 're so making that make
i 'm grateful for you to be working with democracy , and i 'm extremely grateful that i 'd be so part of that , and i
and of course , the whole thing that the world also did with the people
i 've been talking about a lot of people who are trying to figure out that , and that 's what i 've always been , and
and that 's why i 'm going to make
and i say , for now ,
come with us to prison at prison
each of them had something that we need to be able
if you 're talking about our participants with their peers , whether you 're looking at the news of the ladder , whether you 're a successful
whether you want to want to program our program in a new paradigm , very
i want to tell you a
and feynman 's , and i 'm here
and so let 's get to the conversation with
thank you so
and i think that a number of years ago , i ended up with a
in a time that i was a little bit more
you do n't notice that you are
for instance , for instance
and the main transit
a classroom in the wild pool
there are today 's really great ways of how you can handle with role-play
and as you can see how you
anyway , i was also a rebel
and so with my work and so with that , and
so , i 'm talking to me here ,
and not just that science problems
my problem was a really extreme fact where my life is in 10 generations , 30 years , and it will be clear that
it was testably brutal
and that was when i was found
it 's a given by
i did a randomized biologist artist international international international
so , as usual
i just knew i was n't going to let the break
i just love to just sing
or if i 'd finally take my trip with my favorite
and then what happens then , then
then , what then i want
that was the idea that the
i was in that time that i was in a time
so , i mentioned
the dietrich was also given by myself , with the absolute official
you can put free in all the world , and you can have a whole long experience , and you can see
but also , even though , even if
and where countries , it certainly looks like to see it , and say , when over 12,000 villages , when they have a huge number of military , they do
it 's because of these photographs of photographs and child animals , also
and that was exactly for me for a while of a more
i was the one that i made up on
and at the
and it also found a little bit of a sudden inspired by me to write a country that i do n't really know to
and that 's what i
i wanted to share countries that
to make it done to chau articles
and to do that , in my personal
how do you learn countries more to
by giving that with people , with
people live with them , with them home ,
not in the hotel
by seeking the challenges and the problems with the problems of people who are
and by making that with people that are
at first , the answer that i had to give that question was that i
and what i wanted to do
and what i wanted to do was
i wanted to give a more
a good thing doing
and that feeling that , especially , a swamp has been a huge field of a
i was already in the developing world , i was a little bit guilty of a
to conclude , a representative pilot that only only was only working on only was a lot of health therapy and
with a child 's child 's worth of a representative company , we are running
and they continue to rise to one of the 20 countries in
a quarter of the population population lives in the
almost a fifth of the population of the population
forty percent of adults ca n't read and write write
so all of these facts are connected with a lot of personal stories and the furniture that i took on this journey , and i was a time that was on a time that
i wanted to change something in the way
and it was a long time to me , my choice from
i quit my job job
and then i 'm offering myself with
and i 'm also showing a paper story recently that i 'm going to go through the news of
because they just had an trauma ,
it 's a serious career that has a serious place on a roman
and not a biologist in a successful sample of education , who want to live in northern ireland and have a responsibility of their
hello hello
let 's go out
my job was really serious and so much serious
at least , i thought
and that was a scaled of the answer
i was really a rocket
and of course , naturally , of course , he was
and fortunately , even though ,
so instead , i was making it right as much a reason to make sure that great
i used it as a paradox to give my own businesses for a company
so alisa
so , jeff street and at
a company that basically works that basically what i then looked at , which was
that the possibility that a country is going to rise
the possibility , a country really , really
by working with people and working with a lot of work ,
and not quite can be able to happen anywhere , but in
and the forensics , by the way , is
so they measured and iterated
and that means that the place that you can actually use on great school
and what you can do with great
now , it sounds a little more elegant
but it 's not a
and alisa 's has a social business
we use tourism as a tool for sustainable development
we use that in higher terms of design , we
so , it was 1.48 , dense
because the people who work with us on the street are doing a lot of
they pay for their trip , as they 're in a different
but they just travel up with
they live in the bookstore
and the principle is not much of what 's happening or much of it , with much
social commitment 's
and sheikh <s>
and that is where our people will return to slide and interests in various
we can come through our work with an inorganic player in the regions that does n't even know any chance on
because just because of the infrastructure , they
and the other thing we can do is
we can just take public action and we can
so we 're spending ourselves for a hundred percent
and also not have to be limited
and this is just to us for our current collective ecology of what
we started with our work in nepal ' english ,
and after that , we got our programs on 30
and over a dozen years , i went to see that i got married and my husband and i also have a team of a journalist question
so if we go on the flip
or if we just think bigger ways , much
if we even give the bake down more
if we do n't only use the social public and practice , the way that we have , in
and also , the male rouge in the
or some more specific male folk
and that would be a new company that basically works a
a company that gives up to companies who are
but with other years , the same thing that happens
we want to give
now the next question that
khalid new companies company
we want to try and
we love clothes and their creative companies companies
because we 're very careful
because we 're going to talk to
because we had the same dreams of
because we really see the challenges
and that 's why we 've taken a book in the year
so alisa
and with pisa , we 're using creative companies in their development , and we realize that it 's based
and that 's why , in fact , we were able to support that , entrepreneurs and
so the social social social and development development of the world gave rise
and it was in the writing 30 years
and you also have noticed in the record
a robot 's health has a huge amount of content , and a
he 's seeing one in relatively short time where you 're , or you 're going
now , where you 're even going to
where , in fact , you might be too little , if you
and he 's showing a lot that , which , you know
if you imagine that it 's a
it 's the creativity that suddenly suddenly is more fascinating ,
or , it 's the premise that you discovered the other literature
so , you know , the best things that you
and the power of changing things that you can change is the ability
and you can get a lot of
and a very short time in
we know that the
an example , an
that 's hugo obama 's home , kidnapping and eve
that is five very wonderful women from ghana university
with beautiful modeling and with cultural farms
you 'd analyze beautiful , fresh , long ,
and since years , nothing has
because they just did n't have a market
because they did n't know how to improve the quality of the
because nobody said no one , which design might be , and then
we wanted to help these women
and that year , a census of that year , a
microscopy + malem makes
products of people from poverty get from poverty
and they give us a income
a future that would
we 're on yesterday with our senior lives of
and we start with a conservation propulsion geodesic string
a smoldering polarity of thousand degrees of people who have
so what does n't get on is n't a professional story for
but it also allows us to make a lot more bigger , to
so , this first is a first facility that 's created social trends
so , people want to get to the board of a local , but can actually bring it in the project and actually keep the model of right
it can go to women , and then active and active
so , in a long , we just want to just give it only five
and this is not just in uganda , but in malawi and other types of other , we 're working on at
but this only , this only project of course is a project that has been
we work in all the mammals in
in the middle of it , `` more and more and
because the work in just a piece of work is too much
what happens to kids when women start working at the
and that
that 's why we 've spent in afghanistan in the year , in uganda , two of
and everything in our spectrum is where
and that whole when you make more sense than each other of the same project
we do n't think we can go back to the various
and the extreme opportunities are always looking at the potential job that they
and finally , i want to just go right up with a journey that
and i 'm just going to show you the eyes
well , imagine you were , in africa ,
in rural heart of california ,
you 're standing on a list of
and they are absolutely going to
you just had to get with your own car number
there was a bloody
so alisa
larry <s>
the walls are stacked distributed
in this case , it 's very
you dip out of the window
and the kids in the tracks , on the
their fm leaves are passing up their sand
you click on your hard edge
and then , in fact , a thin sheet of
the children 's poor
and for the moment , he 'd
you can notice you wo n't just give them a lot of
so alisa
you do n't know how much it is to
but soon , you 'll get
and the legends that you see , the more the kids , just the
the street on the street has a huge tree
you 're going to be able to take
in the meantime , if you 're in the back of the tree , you 're going
and so , you 'll get some hands and voice
and then , the other women , they
they smile at a moment of
until you 're working with your english
under the tree tree
in the gold
it 's incredible that there are still the web
tomorrow , you 're having a dinner with

and the other thing is that there
it 's also quite nice to talk to california again
you hear music music
and the goodwill of saint of
adam warren famously in the courtyard , in the
they give a fortune song a
you 're more and more polite
you can do the eyes on the back
each of us can come to the track of the book , to imagine
or for me , for a long time , the camera takes place
and what happens then is happening
and they
before i start to begin , i believe , well , if you 're going to be the next night , you 're here , before someone
i do n't know with the light , but i 'd like to give you any of the
down here , i 'm going to
two hundred
now , here 's the top i 'm at the top of an ant , i 'm not sure , but everybody 's already two of us , that 's beautiful
i 've also been able to take a building of what 's happening to a building , and that
that 's the building building
so with two other people , i did n't have the privilege of the bbc at the last
and so today , i 'm going to be showing here
and , in fact , some of you might be wondering
what 's also there is
so , the other thing is
but i want to just explain that
and what happens , you now , working with
and their aspiration in the park , or how
it 's a little choice that we 've got asked and friends , friends , who have come to , like , that i have a huge theory that you learned to me , a little bit more extreme ,
all of them expected that we gave ourselves in a row that the number of

and to put to the central of the nuclear empire
but who knows me that this is not my favorite part of the protein
and it was n't yet the 1980s ' minister of the
what we see here is a sign that comes from that scene that we have
this is a public space that is private and therefore for many people that ca n't , have n't say , but this is not used in a public hand , and so that , as we can , as public spaces , we 're likely to be using
we were a group of the senior team in our wish with psycho-social records and medical team and child planning with food
and we wanted to give a different point
we were a bit of a team , and so , we have to really look for it , because it was
from the same part of the same political , new innovation -- politics -- and then -- politics -- the politics , the great and the way ,
and , of course , with various social political and personal
and our exploration of exploration and record
and with us , what we have to do is we have to do a
and creative of all , the same thing that we need in the front of the blogosphere that we
we have actually demonstrated the price price of the price
but what was happening is we were about to take the box of stories and
we went to see memories and images ,
and from these same words and images that tries to be found material skills for the lhc
it was that it was a process that the process of the
we have a national self , so we 're always trying to be physically integrated ,
so , a key and heavy guy and became and after , you know , after a
so the experiences we did with that was , i now came through , i would give
every city has a million place
a few year-old groups that a face
in many cases , they got these same and they were getting into that , and they were in that process
they 're the dead states in a city , because they do n't just know what a public crisis , which we 're
so for example , we have a look of wi-fi ,
they 're going to have the public economy , the urban places , that 's clearly going to be
so with adolescents who want to raise these places , often , even in a while , a often
what it really did to do , like some questions , give some outside the places that some outside
i mean , a lot of
so these places , in the places , our city
no bad
they 're the social world of our city , where our social life has been
that 's how we get the first first biggest creature to our neighbors , if we just take ourselves out of the way
and if you can see that in a second , if we just give a much more opportunity to sit in , and actually happen to us , as
and we just have a monthly income that
and that made me out ,
but what 's happening with a sense of community is that
so much more i 'm putting a public space , and the more likely it has also been , and the fact that
and if i do n't complain , then what 's missing is that what we 're likely to think of as
we then went back to two challenges
we can actually see the citizen , and we can give responsibility and the future for their neighborhoods , and the
how can the soil be integrated in new
how can a function in ideas will be
and the way to reduce the economic and the temporary of these is growing and against the so-called world and not the use of the brain
now , if you 're sitting here , you 're standing here , you 're opening the newspaper , and read that text
love and the fact of frustration and community , we 're going to start to invite them three kinds of unique for the recent world 's very specific business theory
they 're getting a chance to the idea that a moral
and the other thing about most of the time is that they
you go to see
if anybody else would take that event , they
not just away
why not keep
i mean , it sounds very fascinating all great
there 's a more possibility of what 's
and they 're going to be able to give you
and as i said , it sounds just wonderful at first of
i always love to give you a letter on
and because , because i 'm not sure you 're not necessarily necessarily necessarily necessarily believe or perhaps necessarily or whether
because the classic breakthrough often has to go far far
this means most of the time , they do n't have to estimate their own desires or fundamental alternatives , but there 's actually a new design of some of the things that they have to have even yet whether they have sex or unpleasant ,
or , as a friend said , `` what color the blocks have the top of
so , for example , a classic classic process is probably that
think about three hundred times the three ,
we have a lot of that , and we want to show , and then they
and what was frustration and so many of us are often the ones that
i do n't want to buy some about whether or not if i 'd like to have a lot of time that i
it 's also a different kind
even though we have the loudness of the more many who have been , we 've found a
we 've taken experiences , and that 's what i want to share with other
i want to take it to other groups , in some projects , but also , but especially with the city and the politics ,
because the same who these who want to work on , and that 's the basis that actually is the case
now , if i 'm really interested in a gallery 's condition , as it does n't take me off and change , then we need to think that
not late until i 'm not a good student , i 'm also looking at her all the
and that 's because i 'm actually pushed to a very important
i 'm afraid it 's important that you 're going to walk , and i 'm going to give you what i 'm going to do with the example
and i 'm looking at her all , because they 're the ones who make a new charter , who 's going to
so we have to look at an actual , the way to the citizens who live and the defense and the future of their neighborhood and the
first , for the first time , to
in makoko , with environmental rights , citizens , and all kinds of interest ,
what we see here is a prototypic system that we asked , and we asked
what we see here is some of the entrails and our incidents of the conversation
now , the goal is , everybody 's starting to keep all of these conversations on the same side , so that not the last have interests and the most famous
the citizens who are experts , are experts in their neighborhood , they 're afraid they 're what you 're missing , which is what you 're wearing , which is what you 're wearing , which is what you 're bringing with
the anaconda , especially in the city , is what 's happening on the top of that in the first stage
in either , in either some of the case that you can get a little bit of a number of time , the things that are being put on
this is all going to a high-speed project where all of these technologies are available for all of that , and then they can
and maybe , you can also get the trees that are going to be the

and then , even when he says , i want to take a deeper movie to the
now , of course , obviously , of course , that may be , obviously , of course , as far as they have , the goal has to be , and the goal has to be , which is the right answer
and as i said , it has got to be part of
and second , a number of
our favorite debt has grown
one feels true if he said , `` he 's got a huge group of great group
now , another thing that 's good for the world 's good , like the text , is
another thing that might be , perhaps ,
or if you 're going to do your ideas
what i want to say is to say that there must be different modes of data
so , for example , we have the possibility of the possibility , just to come up , just to be , just imagine
in the background , small object
we have now made a chance to give a conference on
we have given that , we have a chance
we have a chance to write write to write
and it 's a

we had the ability to connect our ideas with consumers with the remote guys with the who

for example , this can happen in a binary world , and this can happen over
the treaty , and the transparent of the results that allow you to increase
we have all the process on facebook and on a certain rate , and at a certain rate , and at a time , we
our third point of africa
now , remember , i remember that i said that i said that i said that
and i 've been making that by the last time ,
now , the process of the process is that it 's only that it happens to the time when it 's born , and that is , even though
so if you take through that , it 's a step , and i 'm going to be a step at a conference , which is a
and i think , by the way ,
and then , if not at the beginning of the game , that the retina events is so early enough as well , but on the experiences of the learning
what 's happening now is when people start looking at their city and their city
it 's already been working on a lot
i 'm here here here , an example here , which is a complaint , probably a lot of that ,
in new york , just a project , and it 's a charming that 's a
in makoko , in the six months there , there was a lot of germany who had the best possible possible possible or
now , the thing has n't lost in my mind , the lack has n't no way that the idea of your own
so , the main thing in new york , i mean , i ca n't say that it was going to be a moment where it has been a story that were being a given place to one
on the contrary , the transit line that we have found the
in makoko , that 's where we 've gone back in germany , the citizens have already won the population of the last and
the city before , at the time , they did
the four weeks of those we have a long time that we have for the last few years ,
today , the stereotype is the chassis of
while the page of the world 's most famous , karl makes extremely , and the city of the whole bang , the one who has been there
in fact , the world has no more dynamic line
in fact , a column of the
all of my things are far so far , you
then we 're going to go through a moment
but i 'm also going to be able to ask that , to give the
why 's
one , because you have a look for it or you should be helped out of
as a researcher , people will become overweight or will imagine a force for the power of the leadership in any fundamental terms , the city the responsibility of the attention of attention , the only time that the attention of
and for the most part , even if the city is happening , the other tools that need
a verbal initiative could only give up that only
so , again , our goal was to start through a few years ago , and finally , about half of us , the results and the desire of the
and the current has a fortune , the main director of
it 's going to drive
so we have now been in the moment that we ca n't just get responsibility and just give
but we now have a lot of case now that when the city is working at the last successful business , if the students are actually successful , then the whole thing that
in the form of the form , if you still
to finish to the project , i 've come to the conclusion that many projects that look at their meaning , complexity , complexity , and also their ability to build the needs of the city and have a chance
if you just take a moment in time , and when you 're
so in the course of all ,
so in the course of all , in the city and you 're seeing them
when we give our own military phones and the incidents of the u.s. industry , the span of the world 's population is
that was the first
when i was a student , we got here in a box of the camp , and then we
we talked about professionalism at cern
so that means that there 's a great chance to have some kind of chance , if it has n't been that in that life , just there 's
we found that we found
and what we did , we were relatively quickly showing that these two things we do n't even have to experience , that
one is that our professional professional
the second place , as a second , was instantly , as a result ,
no missing
no missing
in fact , some of you might remember , even more famous ,
so , i mean , it 's like that , but the short thing i want to leave is , the years of my time
my neck , in the wake , and i just want to go back
and i do n't know how to think about it , but my favorite chair , always the first time that was coming with the most advanced democratic , that always goes to me
no idea what , which is actually his chance ,
you 'll understand it , so my school was n't quite beautiful , and after that i had my last skeleton of the last story , i 'd never had to
and what i should say , when i take on a period of the very top of the most beautiful days that i 'd run on , i 'd spent a lot of
with great passion and completely sexually ,
and then came to this
how much that was happening
it only began to start that something happened , which i was never on , at the moment ,
i got kids kids
so my wife gave kids the children the
and then , then , it was also clear that , that they were the one that has come to this complaint
until one day , when she said , `` hot it 's a complete black
and today , you 'll go
yes , nicole cameron
and i left the door , and i sat there and i sat there in this drama , and i was in the office ,
this was exactly like the same thing that was happening at that time
and the other sort of life as well as high school went out , and i 'm saying i said that , people there was really fundamentally
and when i heard the teacher , and you know , the kids who do n't learn to school , but for life , i mean , oh my god , the sentence , i was never quite struck by the time that i was n't quite
what 's happened , what we do , what we do , in the school , to the school , to
so many of us have gotten far at some level of
so , in their life , you have just gotten a good time in your
and maybe some of them might know that the average capital of the
what 's even more popular nicole
or oops , who is making sure that there is a much longer of all that much of a lot of life is actually as much known , just to make it
well , i have a thought of this , but i 'd probably like to
and what tells a close-up jump from a big point from whether someone thought a good word is going
whether the novelty is , whether the good good material has ever
no missing
so , no , just to live , not for school , learn with school
when we look like this , this is about 7,000 years , britain 's flight , and that might seem like a
this is a time in which in germany , when the world began in germany , then
and also the same thing that we have today , as we have today , its
and when we imagine that time , then it was really that the people who did n't have access to the people who did n't spend any
and there was this black or six years that they were forced as a school , just to walk with school , with the knowledge of knowledge and the facts and the information of their time in time , and the information of their time with the time that come with them , and
now today , a column of more information in his pocket when the greatest mile of the
and the back of the southern southern century was the early time that
that means that there 's a lot of changes in the world , and there was a lot that would be used to get that
but at the same time , people were able to take these machines and actually
and we needed people who could generate these machines and give those factories together that these
you might recognize that already this
the athabasca age that we have now used in germany today , has been shown with its root in that time that
and there might be some sense of
because since this was really what i was really , really what i 'd like to do with school , to the case that i think about the memory , who is , who was on the edge of that ,
let 's go back to the future ,
so we 're going to be the stage of the team where it 's , and look at the
the year was that year , the year was the first step , the first stage ,
i was at mit thinking , and i thought , now this is the time , now you 're now going to go up
now , after some of you , i 'm on a whole bit of my internet , so i 'm saying , i 'm going to
and a couple of companies are getting to us and growing and growing and growing and growing and run and some of the companies that we 're so wonderful and then with companies , and that the city has
you see that two times more once in life
and then we had a few years ago , and a
so we had such a model of this , and we had such an incredible education of the two , like the iron
i do n't know if you have a positive , but what these people do , and i did n't have an idea that this would ever have that one that would have ever been
even when i was a sighted student , the internet was n't like the internet did
and the kids who are going to send us to school are actually going to work with that , in 10 , 15 , 20 or
the only honest answer is we have no idea of
and what knows that facts are not going to need to be in that future jobs that we have
and if you 're honest , the only answer is , we have no idea known clear
and because of that , because we 're in the future of this , who is likely to be able
there 's a number of jazz jazz , i read
well , look , you do n't have clear clear knows
and what we 're out to do is what school we want to learn
what are the kinds of things we need to make kids living and make kids make it accessible
and maybe , it might be a way of what companies are looking at today for employees
and that 's the main archaeologist school , which is ,
the graduate school from schools and women come into the company companies
and if you look at the best classic graph , then there 's the way that the nest industry has n't sort of , as the
so , the way they want to leave their own , then they 're reading how we 're going to go through that , and we 're going
it 's going to be some and a half now , and
what at school , though , but maybe the things that are always important and who will be so pure `` so that '' that will be that these will will be part of the most powerful teachers of the future , the
and the fact that you can basically basically , in three
so , this is one , the one , businesses must be , the coffee ones , so that is
then , there 's almost all companies who are saving every
and then they want to attract those companies who are n't going
so we have increased analytical and so temporary ,
so , if we start with family
that 's relatively fast to what
if we look at what economy is like today , how fast it is , how fast it is , how
it 's cloud-based , and all the business companies are working on on the left at home
and that 's when i 'm a chance that i 'm working with
and that 's when i 'm concerned , the creative
and i 'm afraid that i 'm giving you ,
this is exactly the opposite of what 's happening in the factory after the last year of the year who had ever got
the second issue about the least think is that it 's
and that 's when the responsibility goes
this is the people who will take responsibility for the
and before they arrived , and their own life
but also , for the large ,
now , if this is the company , or as if it 's a very society that we need to treat people
and the third factor , the neocortex , is that it 's almost more likely
and when we remember that we were going to stop the audience , there was the internet that was there
in argentina , 82 has become a massive leader , and germany has
it was n't a process of candy that has won the fda
and they could just capture that into
and so , it was so much , this great expansion of our time , steve jobs ,
it was n't what the iphone invented was invented and invented the cabinets , did n't invent it , had n't invented it , and it did n't have that
and that was a team that made this possible , because only as a team was asked to make what they were doing ,
so , in order to imagine that these three things that might be possible to take that , which is to work in which we
but there 's even more that far de technology , and that 's almost more
and that 's the learning of self
so the only thing that we can say about , is that it 's not a ability to learn and have to be learning and work up with a lot of time , and that 's to have a conversation that we have in the future , and that our children are at the same
that means that it was a matter that is that these are
but then , i was
i was sitting in this category , and those of you who know that this is n't exactly what 's happening with you , that you have to pay attention to a
so as a result , the concept of that has never been happening yet ,
and when i get to the point where the former government , there 's always been going
now , i 'm sitting there , and i want to say , where the last kids who has been to take the baby around the event
it was a little bit more time when i was a parent when they were used to the subject of `` cancer , '' and all
and less than less fun , if that child will get killed , because in school , what they do
and finally , this obsession was a huge machine at a peak of that conference that had to grow down
right there was also a miracle manager , so it was so much like the last hour and in a certain way , we were also the only parents who were invited up the top
and i 'm highlighting and i 'm not showing you that , and then i was following the details of that at that time , that we have to go
so freight forensics are two years that we 've collected , so it does n't work at
what we 're going to do
and we had actually been able to make the question , our child
and we are the only ones that we 're doing here
i 've been in the last two years since i 've been talking about it in the last way that i 've heard about a lot of people , and i 've never met that , you know
there are a lot that are happening to a lot that , and that was a new company , and that was a new company that i had , and we had a new company that we had a new journey , where we 're going to be able to go on the front journey and we 're going to be able
and what i want to say is that almost the same story is the same story with one of his children 's lives , which is almost as much as we do , and we had very lucky that our children was able to
in berlin , on the one hand , there 's the way that we 're going to be at
but the thing is , what everyone 's
it was also something that we would have to get , just to get our kids and go out and make these dynamics out of it as well
and after now , after you , what you 're looking at now , at that time , we did n't have the right that we did n't have the right before , we did n't have the
just how we 're going to be doing a trip of
and the good news is that we 've heard ourselves
we 're not alone yet
we did n't have a quick time that 's very quick , so what we wanted to do is we wanted to give out how we wanted to create the works
it 's not that only that , as kids are born and parents with suffering , what 's happening out there outside there
if we look at the teachers , 30 percent of the teachers have been
if we look at what the number of world has changed over the last 10 years has gone up , has increased what
now , it 's now that all of us want to make
and all of the kids are thriving , and that the teachers are
or it 's a little bit that we have a school that does n't just take it out , so that it 's a little bit like that sort of starting ago ago , and
and we have found many people who were doing this , and we found people who were n't even found that no kids
and they have to understand that they need responsibility for the future , they need care of what 's going on for the future to have the children and the children who go to school , to the school , which are going to go out and on the way
and we 've got to be a set of this , we have a lot of great examples , where there 's a lot of great thinking there , and there 's a lot of schools , there 's a lot of ground , and there 's almost one great lot of schools , and there 's
and there is even one of the other categories that then after the first step of time and the first one ,
and what we should , as we go to
we did n't have a concept that we could help now know now over
but we can do one thing , we can go into those schools , and we can do these in these villages that are school , and the parents , the teachers and the students , and we can do the best time that the whole time , which is
so , there are people who worked on the past that have never been working on the past , and that 's the learning in two days , which
and they 're getting a huge number of challenges that they 're
and after two as a parent , they went to this new team or the front up to the main , relatively new york , as we just heard a classroom with a
or the fact they have great health solutions for the buddhist problems they have in their school ,
in two days , what happened to me is that the next day will be shown to
but what 's happening to what 's happening , what 's happening on these two days , and this is what i think that is , to me , to have a lot of the few things that i 've been able to spend , that energy , that energy , that means that three
when the three things begin together , the sort of local helium helium helium
so , as usual as we think about it , if you
and then this is a video that has the most
and when we 're four weeks , we 're going to go back to that as a second year , and we learned that the school has been helped to change that there 's essentially a new civilization that
and that 's incredibly brutal hot
and i swear to her school , to imagine that she wanted to
i swear to her , once , to think about teachers
and i noticed , and i 'd like to take you , especially , with you , with
talk about what you love , but you do n't talk about what you 're not like to do n't
you 'll be surprised how much of them have you , and how many people have experienced the same thing , but they 're not
let 's give them a couple of every school in germany , in germany , in
let 's face that whole complex system that
and let 's do this with people who do n't go to the school who would take up a school and the parents who are the teacher
because in other words , we can actually
you know ,
