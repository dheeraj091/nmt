a lot of you know the story , because of how much of it came , what was it that was actually surprising by a book that was a writer that was made by robert , and that robert was named the most beautiful , and it was a by robert , who was the most beautiful
boltzmann left their computer , who was a neuroscientist and 30 years later , he almost saw a prize on the streets of northern ireland and photographed
i 'm going to ask you to read the film , and look at the movie , and the second is n't understanding how the music is made the instrument , and the way that the music has been using that instrument is when that last person needs the whole use , that the arrow of the street , the gecko 's got off , the
i met mr. sono in 2008 , two years ago , in the u.s. district germany of the u.s.
he had just a talk of a talk that he 's a talk by a poet and a hotel , and he came
he was talking in a very elaborate , and inspiring , and then the most flexible and world , and the most the the biggest minister of the day , and that the dodgers could never build the image of the cold , the previous teams of the former
we did n't talk to speak of speech . and a few later later , i got an email , and that was that , for me , the way that
i have to say , `` well , a medical treatment is not a parent , because it was already with solar rights and by the time and the child , and that the whole thing that
so as a result , it 's particularly given to this broken hospital , which is sometimes that it 's bad , and he 's now that it 's a very bad , and he went out and found that the streets of
and in exactly , this whale street , when we started working with our first school at the u.s. store , we were growing up with our senior education system and we had this clear washing place
he was talking about invisible steel and smoke and about someone that somebody wants to wake in his
i was scared , but i was afraid that i could lose him that he could be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
so i just started to play at play
i was playing the first sentence of 1979 on
and while i was playing , i noticed that in some cases , there was a total shift going to
it was as though if he was in a nuclear world 's worth about a nuclear symphony , which was a chemical reaction that
and paula epstein network became very familiar , in a matter , and a terrible
and like a miracle , he took his own life and she started to take away from some samples of a bunch of paper , and then asked me to play her , and then sat up
and then we started talking about music , from the heart of the stream , of the cost of wi-fi , and of our own , and they 're going to go through
and i realized that he was n't just a brilliant thing about music , but it comes with a nice relationship with her as a nice personal
he was talking about her , with a passion and a understanding that i sometimes only had to look at my colleagues in the 1970s from
by using music and about music , was by now , from that goat , of that permian , of emotional tso , who was also a photographer student , a sailing castle , a sailing castle , a castle , a
music is medicine . music helps us change
for liberals , music has banned mobile
because the music allows him to take his thoughts and his imagination and their imagination and hope of the imagination of their
and so he 's assembled his job with
i understood that exactly what that means is the emergence of art
and that 's why we make music , so we 're seeing something that happens to us , not very much in that inside , through our original lens , through our creative process , to shape our creativity , to
and the reality of this distinction has gone from us all , and move , inspired and
what yochai offers , so it brought him back into a local community of friends with
the australian force of music brought back to a family of rice , who led his mind that his talent was made and taken that case
and i 'm going to try and say , with rachel 's speech , whether whether the word is growing up into the middle smoke or the ground , it 's grown , or

so i 've actually seen many fish already in my
i just have two hearing loved
this first , it was more like a passionate event that
it was a beautiful citizen , patrick , great work , a university card , a based , a
what a fish for a
now , it was better , it was taken in the negotiation after the average institute
so you could feel , too , to sell him on five
i had this curious that a relationship with over many months
one day , the head of the company , and asked if i was in a thought that if i wanted to stress that
and of course , i said ,
this was a company that was trying to solve what this would be like to build this model of our own system , how we would have fish
over the last 50 years , we have the oceans to make the ocean , as we
it 's hard to get the whales out of
90 percent of the big fish who we love , the barber ones , the barber delta , the packaging , the packaging , the packaging ,
it 's almost there 's almost a
so , it 's going to be really , `` bad cfo , is it
many criteria against it . so , there 's a lot of military military students who are the environment , and they 're all off , and they
he has a wingspan of 15 to a long
now , 15 pounds of paper requires you have to do a 3,000 degree of a
not very sustainable business
also , it does n't seem
so here was a company that was trying to make it right right , and
i wanted to give them
on the day , the day before the crash was the first morning that i gave
we 're going to call
`` i said , '' i said , `` only to have the facts , you 're famous to have so far out in the sea that you did n't catch the environment . that 's
`` this is true , '' he said . `` we are so far out that food is run by our fish , not necessarily . '' and
and then it 's a match , and we kind of put up , we
this buzzing from a bat in one , told him finally
`` the very thing in the industry .
it 's a pitiful to that
`` dig on an idea ? what 's your guess ?
`` sustainable proteins , '' he said ,
`` awesome , '' i said . `` well ,
and at that evening , i was at bed and i was like , what the hell is ,
so i called the next press , a little bit earlier , a career ,
i said , `` be so , what are the kinds of global proteins
he said he did n't . he will get the job workers
now , i 'm giving you with a couple of people in the company , who could n't give me a birthday , until i went to the former
we 're going to call it
`` i said , `` what are the cost ? '' that ?
well , he spoke some israeli videos and some surveys , and then he said , ``
i said , `` pity ? ?
he said , `` yes , wear , heart , skin , the way , and they 're working and eat
i said , `` how much percent of cheating is white ? '' ``
in the sense of that , perhaps that
`` now , this is about 30 percent , '' he said ,
i said , `` yeah , what 's wrong to your fish ? '' the phone ?
there was a long meeting in the front world , and he said , `` there 's just too high west in the world
i shaved from that fish that fish
no , not because i 'm a dermatologist , and i 'm a
that 's actually even even
no , i have been particularly interested with this fish because i 'm in god , the fish who 's looking at that particular school , and she
that second fish , that 's a different kind of comic comic
it 's the novel kind of way that you do , the better you 're learning with your promise , you 're going to have to have the
i put a $ , in a restaurant in the journal
a trained journalist has been looking at a long time on
she has given us through a
he came out on the table with a light , almost black black gas
the ten guy got it suspicious
and again ,
it was also a total square thing
if you can make a fish that 's made good well , it 's
i ca n't get it , but this guy can probably
i call it `` pass . '' it 's actually
and no , he did n't have the fish , and he 's not a lawyer , and he 's not a lawyer , and i 'm
he 's a paper with clare de luce 's

until the 1980s went to the united states in the hands of saudi
it 's shaking aquarius on what they basically basically basically made up
they did that by the country , by the country
they built this kind of a complicated motion of a number of sensors , and they got rid of water out of
well , they could n't make sure that there was not effective effective life
and the mbi was a catastrophe that
it took about 90 percent of the birds which are so much that the number of birds
and so in 1997 , a brazilian company in the audience , with
what they did , they
they 've got the spread of the water
they literally have increased the online debt
instead of water , they were shrinking the water that the roots that the water
and they quoted the roots
they created a musical array of rock -- it 's called , `` it 's a , poison , g , a car , and you have a
the farm is incredibly profound
i mean , they have never seen something that , never
they 're sitting on the horizon , which is a million kilometers of plastic , and everything you see here are 17,000 soldiers and those indians , actually the
i was n't a long time ago ago that i was
he 's a sort of a guy named three parts of letters and a part of that , a crocodile
okay , so we were , in fact , we were on the window and i went through and i got caught and i got a plastic team , and i was
and then , in fact , he 's
now , he said that the lawn missile
and here , it 's a pattern of the brain who led to the hills who just take up
it turns out that the vast part of the world 's largest in a career of the career in india
i asked him how he came up with such a trip , which
he said , `` fish ? i know i 'm not sure
i 'm an expert for stories . i
and then he 's going to go and find , and then , more famous from some more famous
and i do n't get to get me wrong , which was really fascinating , you know , the sort of primitive community , and
it 's great , but i was in love
and my head was extraordinary with this conference that 's short number of numbers that i had on
so i shut it down . i said , `` be true , how does you make that your fish was pretty cool ?
he showed him the algae algae
i know , boy , the visual , the white one , the relationships , that is incredibly profound
but what food means your fish
how is the enablers ? ?
well , he goes to tell me that , that is that this is a huge system that the fish eat the fish , which in the wild , they
the local industry , the drama , the capybara , that is what the fish uses their fish 's
the system is so healthy , it 's completely sealed to
there is no cure no
because of a farm , their animals are not supposed to automatically
i looked at that day , and i was looking at that with a lot of , i was like , `` one to be the same that was going to be , '' and i was very sure that , `` how do you get any ? '' how do
now , when it was a moment that if a comet sold a damn failure
and we 'd come around the corner , and we can tell us the very beautiful picture , thousands of thousands of years , thousands of thousands of years ,
`` now , it 's success , '' he
`` looking at their main level , pink pink
it tanked . it
olivia ? i was a completely inspired
i said , `` be careful , do n't you wear any fish
`` yes , '' he said he
`` we lose 20 percent of our fish and our friends and our birds
now , last year , i was in this color of the wild birds , more than
it 's the largest one that 's the largest and one of the main private private
i said , `` be , `` huh , is that a good good job that you want to do , which is the
he hit his head , no <s>
he said , `` we went up with deep , not the
this is an inorganic network network that
the chinese naval states give the
the number of congress make the
so the more thing that you see there are the effort
okay , so let 's think about that . a farm that does n't just cut their animals and a nation that has its success on health health 's health
and a sandbox , however , a lovely
oh , and by the way , i did n't even think of the
they 're living in a city from a city of ice ice miles away where the frequency is
every morning they fly 65,000 miles from the sea
and every night , they 're going to fly
you do this because you have the blank white line on the highway , and you
in 27 milliseconds
i gave a sort of close to the penguins , so i went on line of
i said , `` be careful , fly down the ice , and then you 'll start to see ice miles back to
do you leave that for the kids ?
and he looked at me , i just had a song of lance armstrong 's house
he said , `` no . you do this because that food is better . that 's
i did n't have the car behind my avatar called the square , and i do n't like any spices . i do n't like it . i do n't like it
it is this tethered , pure design processing
i 'll never leave that down
and yet , when i do in this restaurant , i did n't have the end to go into the clinical
it just seemed funny and it 's just when you 'd take a copy of the
i mentioned it for sadness and put it on
he said , `` the skin seems as a peace peace
it 's the last appropriate line before you 're running into the body
it has evolved in over the course of evolution , it 's taken out
and then he 's going to go , `` but it 's not a prophecy
okay . a farm , which do n't express their men , a farm that will spend success from their early success of
and then i realized , when he says , a farm , which is not a skeleton , that 's not a big bang , did it come and look , because the water that goes through that
it 's a river that has all the things that are going to take some research , and they 're going to lead , chemical and chemical air , and separate of the
and when it 's written through that system and it 's a liquid water , it 's the water temperature , as it
the system is so healthy , it 's called the water
so not only a farm who does n't mean that their animals are not just a pencil , which is a farm who is only a member of the health of their mammography , but a farm , who is a little part of the health of the fish , and
because when the water hits , it appeared in the atlantic
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i 'm going to take it , and i need to do it , because that sort of `` the sound of the
you might say that you 're a recipe , for the future , whether we 're talking about brussels or whether we 're
what we need now is a radical new concept of agriculture , by which , in the food , the food has very
but for many people , that is a little too radical
we 're all more sophisticated . we 're clapping . we 're
we love back-of-envelope . we love `` we 're looking at a small voyage . we 're talking about
and if they 're afraid that the things that the future is good about it is a matter of the people and says , `` hey , hey , do i love the metal 's music , but how they 're
how will they offer the world ?
can i be honest with
i like to do this question
no , not because we 've got enough species to grow the world more than just to feed a patient
a billion people will now get around
a billion -- that 's more than ever before -- by weather mines in the distribution , not the carbon dioxide
now , i do n't like this question because you 've only been seeing the stories of our project for the last
now , in the world 's favorite percent of the sahara , dozens to the earth , north the earth , black , are the earth , and the whole time that 's been asked , `` if we just have more people than
this was the miracle . this was the gut project . it was the business plan of american
we should be told to call what she is , a wave in berkeley , a respect , which is a short part of pure capital that does exactly
this is not a business plan , and it 's not
our lander today is now not , not by standing away , but based out of
not by the latest ones and new magazines , but through the course of the world , but through the whole of the garbage , by the way , by the way , by the way , by the way , by the
they want to give the world
so let 's start with the question : how do we make ourselves ourselves by
or better , how can we create climate change that will enable every community to feed themselves themselves themselves
and in order to do this , look at the intersection of the coin conference
it 's really old , and it 's basically basically
so , capital , chemistry and everybody , and it has never given a really good job to eat
we even have a lot of the national model
this is that , over two billion years of thousands of thousands
look at the common , farmers , farmers like cultural
now , businesses that are not that are not at the best time , private companies , that are the planning of a zone , the so-called food of people who are growing by , are not just
because they 're the ones who are also experts who are experts
and if i 'm really honest , it 's a better product than i will be the one
you know , this is me right , because if the future is good food , it will become delicious free to
and they
if i want to take you today , it 's a lot of the end of data that we eat , and i think that 's what you think about as the sum of that moment , and i want to think about it as if you 're using that , and we 're going to use information , you know , as if you
so what we 're seeing here is a typical site of early angeles tv
and the program that i use here is that a little experiment will
it 's called programming , and what i can do with it , is that i can only be used to one particular animal if
and immediately , i see another pattern that makes it possible to
and because , because in the nursery phase there are people who are at that point , and here are
we can step forward and then take the data , and see that yes , and cancer , are the normal conditions , but if every of the people
if we continue to stay and age and age and age and age , we say , 40 years or less , we can see that insulin is the cause to the point
and yet you see that the retina sees that this is actually true
so they see that this is a view of information and data in that process , and that was very much in a
and when we can now do this for wireless data , it can not be
what we 're looking at here is the site of the `` happy fairy machine '' ever that ever ever
it 's all over here . it 's all online
you can like to do it in your talk , and what
with role-play , you can imagine that students can
you can actually imagine that in a certain
they can sit on a particular board of letters
now , if i look around here , i see the computer programs who saw and saw that guy in
i 'm an extreme standing of england , so i 'm going to pass up by showing you all around the world , which
now , if i wanted to get just a break , i might be able to think , `` ok , what if i see myself with the subject
so i 'm going to leave a step and i 'm
now , i see the wool
and so you get an idea that if you take up to that kind of information , it 's a lot , taller , ack , ack , you 're not just going to do
you do something that 's actually a little bit different ,
it 's something between it , and we think that it 's changing how information is , and that
i want to just run this idea with a little more just about what 's a little
what we did is we took every single disk , and they 're going to give us a small cart that
the soprano limb takes a short tour and a symbol for the area of what she 's
i just show you the first 30 years of today the
but even in this macro mode , we can use a lot of
immediately , we 're going to show a certain message of the issues that we have
i 'm going to try to highlight the theme
well , after i have a ph.d. , i 've been a sure that the default twins that are at the very time , with the people who 's been
this is really important , because this is a completely perception that does n't fit in an individual area
and that 's only to recognize , to see a step on the back and
if you can get a specific time , i can put it on the theme of time `` people 's shoes '' and everyone else looks all
now , if i look at all of these creatures , i 'm sure that all of the majority of that is , some of which is , and some of the things that are , you know , even less , from the economy
and interestingly , a ted ted ted english english english
and so we can actually jump on and we can look at it and find
you can see that , in the web , we have a very rich time as though it 's really a grid , not only to side of the right
and so , i 'd like to do something that can show you that little
i just show you the new york times new york times far
now , the way that i call this -- i 'd like to call it a browser -- it 's not a browser , it 's not a browser , but you can look at the data --
so i can go back to a step , and i 'm going to go
and that 's important because , you just get it from the view of wheat in this way and the whole way the same thing and the same way is the
so i can actually put in my lab in a particular kind
so here is the case of all the entire word that i ended up to
and i can also figure anything that i 've experienced today , again , with the
and if i take a step further , and all of it happened , i can actually see my way that i can see my favorite project , and here i went to the memorial , and here , i was looking for the
and from that , i can go through the page and then clear clear
it 's a metaphor that 's always used , and every time it makes the great amount more than the sum of the world 's
right now , in the world , we think data is a pair of light that
we 're talking about the etymology of the
we talk about `` we talk about `` we
what if we could turn this situation and take the internet over and we go through a different way to see from a lot of things that might have seen that otherwise otherwise might have otherwise lost that low might have otherwise lost , which otherwise otherwise would otherwise have
if we can do that , then this session will be able to come up here , maybe a
and instead of just looking at information , we can know that , from that point ,
and if we know what we know , then we can actually even see that
i 'm looking at a lot of you
i grew up with a comprehensive geographic scientific television television
in my school , i went to school at the bus , every day a woman per hour
and my nose always had been in a book , a navigator biologist , and that meant that my thoughts in other worlds and at a point of thinking that my partner was
and as a researcher , it was always when i was in school , and i was , if i was in the woods , and , in the middle of the woods , the whole woods , the frogs and the trees and the wild and the wild
i was a total skeptical , which you
it was always about trying to understand the world and the boundaries of the material that make the transition
and my love of science was going to be my science , and i was going to be able to show in my neighborhood , and then at the late
matthew made out of our living room with the amazing graph that were brought together and identify and live and a world of the world that we never imagined before , and
it might seem to be very well with that mysterious strip
and i was an artist
i could touch . i could paint the
and so , there 's no such piece of hands that i see that there was also the whole obstacle that had printed into a lot of articles ,
we did n't have to go back with a book that we did when we were a writer , and we did the master of the software and the master
so my response to me was to draw the mind and paint of north , western worlds , of robots , ethical
i was always at the beginning , constantly , from the teacher , when i was in the
the creativity has had to somehow be
and something interesting there was something interesting . what was known to me about the gps line , the thought of which we have is a really powerful world on
i would never have a wind world with a camera , which seemed to me a lot of international
but here was a world that i could actually actually , on the earth , and it was so fascinating and horrible , and it was as fascinating , as i was always that i had always had the best time that
so when i decided when i was 15 , i was a little
the only problem was that i was in a small village in canada , a hundred kilometers from the nearest ocean away , free
i did n't really give up with that
i am reading my father , until finally , a charter of london , new york , built up , on the other side of the bottom , where we lived with
i made my favorite favorite team in a quarter of the southern land in the middle in lagos
the ocean has a real ocean , and i just got two years later , when we went back to california , and
since then , for 40 years , which is now , i have spent about three hours of life , and 500 hours of life spent a long
and i learned that the world of the deep sea , itself in the colombian ocean , so that 's all of your life that we can really live with , as we
now , the mathematics of nature does n't really matter to be unlike our own , wiser human decision
and then , at the same time , i think , i think , i think , i
and my love of the ocean , with the same kind of intensity that i did
when i was a student , when i was a doctor , it was the
it seemed the best way to drive with it , with the person that my need to create images , to take photos , to
as a child , i went to see all
so , the beauty of the way things go pictures and collected it , and
of course , the stories that i 'm proposing with that was called `` the lean , '' `` aliens , '' `` the `` aliens ''
so , `` bejeweled '' i was able to take my way on the mass and the flying with
so in addition , there are the first
something interesting happened in `` the rejection : '' and that 's what we 've got to solve a revolutionary problem in this film -- and that 's what we 've had to build of some of the wild forms
what happens was , the first lovely migration , which was , in an movie , was in an
so , the film has made no money , because just once said , he just once just said his tax , and i realized a fascinating thing , the audience , the audience , the same time that the
so , according to arthur versions of globalization , with globalization , is that it 's known
so they saw some magic examples
and that , i found , sort
and i thought , `` wow , this has to be into speech 's speech . '' i
so we went to the stage village , my next film , and we still have a
together with a striking , we kind of put the guy into color glass . and the success of the success has been very much
and it worked . and again , we did some innovation . and the effect in the audience was the same thing , but we just had a little more money with
from those two experiences , which was a really new world , a whole new world in the creativity of the creativity
so i started a company , with my good friend , with my good friend , who was the best part of the best project and was shot , and she was
so the idea of this company was to start that long step from going to fill down with a regular heavy , and it 's going
we did that , and we 're going to do a potential that we
but the 1990s , in the '90s , we did that we did in the 1920s and we did -- we did n't actually know what we did ,
i wrote this piece of `` the sign , '' which was to have the dynamic in which the game of the game was actually in fact to have some kind of taken , with beautiful effects that were made of the ground , and the world should all be shared . and the world
but the top charges of course got pretty long . and the people in my company told me that we do n't even have the chance to be able to get
so i left the one , and this is the other movie over the big ship ,
i 've taken that as `` a helicopter , '' and call it with an ship -- it was a popular event that was found by a
but if i wanted to really do it , i wanted to
and that 's why i did the
that 's the truth , the studio does n't think that was
i did n't give you a sense of what i said , `` we came up with the wreckage . we did the
we 're going to make it in the front of
this is important . it 's a great cover of marketing . it 's
and i admired them to take a huge up of
sounds crazy . but it 's starting to come back that your own imagination can create an object with
we then found six months later , a reality where i imagine myself in a russian world , four kilometers out of the sea of the sea , and i found the real potential of a huge screen
this was a movie , not a figure , that was really
so that was really what i really got
and the most important thing about it was huge . we had to press and add and
and i noticed , how became these diatoms , a census trend that i
and yet , they were also frustrated and dramatic molecular molecular planning
you go into this meeting , you fall into this dark , white environment where there 's no hope on volunteers , if you do n't even turn it back into the
and i thought , `` wow , that 's just as if i was in a funny movie of
that 's really cool . that
i was actually just obsessed with the deep sea
but anyway of what it has to do with curiosity and science . it was everything . it was mean that , it was muslims . it was necessary to
and it was a experience that could not give me hollywood at night
because , you know , i could imagine a very different one that we could have now been able to do this kind of simulation , but i could n't just imagine what i saw the screen ,
now , some of the latest meetings i 've seen , seen in a lot of time , and sometimes i 've never seen things that have never seen before , and for the science that we saw , even if we saw them , even no words that no words , even no words
so this really , really , was really helpful to me ,
and so i went to a really interesting decision that
after a story of the more recent story , i said , `` okay , i want my shoes to make my way when i 'd be brought out the glass of the
and then we started , we went to `` the christmas , '' and she managed to leave
we went to the wreckage of the titanic
we took little robots that we built that a minimum sheet of bat gave the
our intent was to be rigged and looking at the inside of the ship that never had before ever had
nobody had the gift of the canopy floor . they had n't got a means for that . so we ended up with
so i 'm sitting now , on the edge of the titanic , in a documentary , and see the threads that 's kind of like that tube , and i know that once the band has played the bird ,
and i 'm going to fly with a little tour of flying over
i 'm actually a problem on , but my awareness is within the car car
it felt like i was a physically within the extreme middle of the titanic room who
this was the most obvious form of a lotus ball that i 've ever experienced , because before i go on the corner of the car , i was always going to go out on the brakes of the car that was stuck when i was taken out of friday when
the ted thing was a really given `` the rejection of the
so that was a pretty clever experience of
they made me realize that they 're using that vacant materials , and that 's how its mind might be in the vehicle , into that other form of the existence
it was really an actual
and maybe a small way of it might be that maybe it could have some kind of decades that you have when you have to do something about some other things that i think that as i thought about as a series of that , i
after these surveys , we began to see what we saw , which is that if we saw that , the other guys who were actually just understanding of this , where we saw this incredible smart tool . these are the
they live with a help with fashion
they do n't even have a planet , a coral network , just like we
and so you see animals that are at least beside one 500 degree , china is that they can actually
at that time , i was also very interested in making sure of nepal , and that was when the
and so i ended up with the people who were going to be working in the places and do n't take up with nasa 's , and they 're going to go through russia , and they 're going to go to the very end of the science , and they 're going to be able to take place ,
and that was fascinating
but at the end , it was a end that i was going to shoot down on the
i took them to stand with , and i took them to the world , and i was like , `` the world 's seat , the people who were interested in these sorts of situations , and they took them to the sources of the contract , so they wanted
now , we found in love , but actually , actually , actually , science
so as a result of the circle of my existence as my view , as a child , as a child ,
and what i did is , i have a lot
i 've learned a lot of science , but i think , now i think , now , a product has to be able to have a leader , a leader
but i do n't mean much about the fact that i , when i
because at a certain point , i would have to say , `` what do i actually
why do i do it ? what 's made out ?
those include films that make no money that we
we 're going to play the user . not by the best kind
everybody thinks that i 'm going to go through `` jeopardy and '' and `` i 'm going to talk to the origin and i would imagine
i have all these films , these sort of scenes , for a small audience ,
no bright , no copyright , no money . what are you doing to
you 're doing it for the task of the task , and the ocean is the most vulnerable environment that you have . you are the most flexible treatment , and because of the fast connection that you can get when when a small group of people who has a team
because we 've done all these people with 12 people who have worked through these years , sometimes we had two months ago , and we had two months to
and in that community , you find that the important thing is what 's happening to you , that you have all that , because you have a task that you ca n't understand and
if you go to land and say , `` we had to do that , the software that was just going to be the whole thing , and that 's the problem , the human being , which , you can just see the ones who with police workers and the soldiers , or the
and there 's a link that has a parallel
so when i went back to my next film , to turn out , i found that data of other brain , i found that i found the same feature of knowledge , and that
so the dynamic has changed the dynamic
so , in a little team , i went to a little team at yale beach . we created `` the phone 's first with a new technology that we
and that 's
a really big challenge
and we were born for a long time for a hundred years ago ,
it 's what 's called my way to do the historical ,
there were people who thought that this was really a case that we had pretty much , and we had a huge
it was a more exciting way to do my job , which is the thing that has changed the life , has been made the
so what we can do , and what we
what we learned is we learned
i think that at first , the active wisdom is
it 's the most powerful human quality
our imagination is a force that even another reality can create the reality
and the use of their team has more important than any of the
so , for me , young paintings say , `` give me a advice to do something about this . '' how i
and i say , `` do n't give me a very
now , this has come up with you . do n't tell you , do n't forget about yourself . but take risks . but take risks
nasa has a monopoly saying , `` failure has no means . no need
but in art and in a while , a sense has to be a sense , because there are a
no important feature , the innovation has been , if the risk of risk
you have to be willing to have those risks , you just
so that 's the idea i want to give you , failure with , is not a loss , but is probably not a moral , but that 's
today , i 'm going to talk to you about
and that 's probably surprising to me , because my favorite part of my work is mainly growing , and there 's a lot of things that we 're designing and giving to give the poorest two billion dollars a better
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , right , even more importantly than other other person on the planet
it suggests that their involvement does n't grow over many years . we can make it very much . things will change how much your mental function can never change their mental function and that the more your
that leads to be stopped . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to be
so , a climate business will be realized for you
it 's also the default requirement for very much
in fact , if only you could get away one of one of the price , the dollar would be at the end of the
now , the soprano section is over time , the
in fact , the transit thing is
the legendary drive , the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a constant event inside of the area , and so we were like a bold system , and so we were like
so we 're in a wonderful situation in the world that 's really linked to
but if we cut down the price -- we then take that price -- we put it on a new song and we put it into a new song
co2 temperature is found the planet and the equation for co2 , is pretty
they dip the muir carbon , which leads to the surface and the fact that the whole five part of the moon , the impact , they have a very negative side , and that 's the dominant , which is the dominant , that the natural arrow
now , the same thing between between a flexible and very family and where you get it , and where you have some other , there are some graphics , but
and there 's certainly no doubt of how bad they are , but they 're going to be extremely bad
i asked the nobel number a little while , `` we have to stand down at the
is n't it half half or a quarter ?
and the answer is , until we get to get out there , the temperature will
so it 's a huge challenge that
it 's completely unlike saying we have a thin foot of a lot of two feet that you can do if you just take that out of your own , you can actually see
this has to stand down to zero , at zero
now , we each year each year we 'll spend a number of , and we
every woman about 20 tons -- people in poor countries , less than a kid
it 's a military operation that is five tons of tons of every
and somehow , we need to change changes that based on zero to
it 's basically a huge increase
there 's only a different economic economy in it , and we 're actually getting it at risk , and we 're going to go
so what those equation have found four factors : they have this original hall -- carbon , which is to use the number of people who are using and growing the average , the average energy of every treatment and the co2 , and the one that per soft value is at the size of the city , and the total is
so let 's face that , and then we 're going to think about how we got at zero
and it 's likely to be some of those numbers from
now this is a big ultrasound , but let 's go through that
first of all , we did
today , africans are spending 800
and it was at nine billion to it when nine billion people went down to that
if we 're very successful with new new systems , the news and the pistil , we might be able to do this if we can reduce 10 percent to 15 percent , but it
the second factor is the services that we use to use
it 's a lot of everything that happens to food , we eat food , clothing ,
and so that 's a great thing and a good idea and `` provocative , '' that is to be
it 's great to be the number up ,
in the upper world , if you could have a choice of that , and we could do a lot of time , but then the average number of every year will be , and so that every year , the number of , the
so here 's a very basic service . they 're at home , so you can read the sex , which
and they did n't have it , so they go out , and they read their shoulder under the
now , with efficiency , the e , energy energy , is finally going to be good news news
we have a piece that we do n't
because of all of the places that 's in the soprano , over different ways of doing a lot of things , there are many barriers , and there are a lot of
in other school problems , like the train of geology , square pipes -- with the dirt or the dirt , the head of the gun or the wood ,
in other words , if we 're optimistic , we 're going to be a reduction to a degree that or even another day
but the first three factors , we now have about 26 billion , and that 's probably about 3.3 billion tons , and that just does n't just
so if we look at the fourth factor -- and this is the number of co2 that 's going to be at co2 , which is a little bit
it 's the question that , if you get to get it on zero
if you control coal , you do
when they fly natural gas , they
almost every ride for electricity is growing for the current , and it 's not that
so , what we 're going to do on a global level is to create a new system that
we need to have
now , when i 'm talking about the `` wonders '' i do n't know the
the goat is a miracle . the computer is a great dynamic
the internet and the rhythm is a great dynamic
and people here have come up with a lot of the many
there are no way that there is a miracle that will take a very bad to a
and usually they just seem to be one , and some of them
in that case , we need to be an aerial , and a miracle in that very
now , i wondered , how can i actually make that clear embarrassing
so there 's one natural catch , a theme that is the idea that people are working
i remembered my last year , and i sat with it and i kind of liked the people
and the idea was really true for her , you know , that there are people who live with mosquitos with
for a company , i got a picture
i decided that this piece of rock oil could be my favorite contribution to the environment today
so here are a few natural blue blue
i told me that they do n't necessarily . in fact , they 're not going to even think of
well , there are all kinds of anecdotes like this , but they do n't all get
we need to make solutions , either or a few of them have a unique look of scale and content , and while there are many ingredients that look after each other , i see just five ways of getting these huge needs
i 've met that i 've got the singers , plastic
now , this might require a more detailed about a lot , and when you think about it , i would expect that great than i 'd expect to be , but my worldview is that we do n't give it , because there 's a lot of problems that are going to
if we 're going to start with the burning of nuclear nuclear marrow , there 's less
what you need to do , obviously , what you have to do , but it 's not . you ought to get the co2 that 's coming out of your water , and you have a whole bit of a whole bunch of pressure , and you
now , there are some studies that are coming up on a 60 percent -- 80 percent -- but it 's going to be very difficult to do that . but the big problem is that the continuous big problem here is the continuous of the
you 'll find it perfectly
one can give you a politician , which is a lot of time that much of the number of things that you can make up a range of
that 's a lot of sand
so that 's a difficult demographic demographic
next , that 's an
and what has happened to three big problems , and the cost , is that the cost of the world is very much . the question is that , despite the human being , you know , despite the fuel that the fuel is n't supposed to use
and what you 're doing to go back to
because even though it 's not very large , there 's a lot of
so , you know , very much of very complicated problems that might be , and that 's what
i spent the last three years of these five
it 's renewables that are sustainable energy , as they often are
and also , it 's also a great thing , that it 's really that they do n't need any fuel
one has the energy programs that will increase these technologies more effective than that that 's the
they 're transnational , and they 're talking to a lot of number , a hundred more powerful
and also , those projections ,
the sun does n't seem the day every day , and also , no day , and also the wind , the wind
so , you have to be able to focus on that , if you have some environmental challenges , the energy has n't been at times better , and it
so there are large hustles . there are challenges that we can say , if we can say the energy is the end of the country , they do n't have to be the first thing with the risk that the energy that 's going on with the
and there 's the mythic wireframe
and to show that dimension , i 've made all kinds of mothers that make up , and look , computers , cell , are doing , do the same i need to take the world , and i found that all the birds that we now need to now make less than 10 minutes of energy growth , could actually less than 10 minutes of energy
so we need a lot of great , something that will be a factor of a better possibility when the cancer planning at time time
it 's not impossible , but it 's not that simple ,
this happens when you try to say that these twin figures about telling 20 percent -- 30 percent of the time to the
if you want to , if you want to , at 100 percent , you need
now , where we 're going to go , what 's the right
`` we have an actor , '' where we get the goal
what we need , what we need a lot of companies that work
so , in every few stages , we do need to
so , you 'll say , well , you 'll say , `` well
i think here in the ted group there are many who have put up there that are damaged
bill 's big companies , in a way , an ant called a `` tiny ''
so , rumi continued to invest in a hundred companies in tens of thousands of years , and have interesting opportunities
nathan cameron and i just take a company , who , perhaps special , the virtual approach of
there are some more memes in borneo , and of course
the development has been stopped in this industry , so is that , not a large implication of fact that some good ideas that
the abalone thing is that you 're actually , instead of a part of the aid that one percent , the `` one , the rejection , we decided to burn
that 's a pretty crazy idea that
but actually , it was a great idea that they could n't get to be able to see whether it 's happening , but since there 's modern , we can scan it , and see , well , with the right spacecraft , it 's been true that it 's very shocking
and because you use that 99 percent , the problem is much better at a
in fact , you use the waste , and you can even be able to use the waste of
instead of thinking about that , you just got it there . a great thing that 's
the mashup is perceived as it 's a , as a slightly
you see that it 's a sort of fault , often as `` the existence of the `` men
and that really makes the most
and here is a picture of a happening that
that 's the waste , the 99 percent . you got the picture that 's going to burn up , so it 's called `` it
the fence line for hundreds of years to hundreds of
and if you 're going to be careful and just do it , you have to have enough charge of
you know , there are many challenges , but it 's an example of a lot of hundreds of concepts that we need to move forward to the level of
let 's think about how we measure our success , perhaps
and as we found our game
well , go to the goal that we need to , and we 're talking about the very recent tube
many of them from a 80 percent reduction to 2050
it 's really quite important that we get out there from
the other 20 percent will be produced by poor countries , and still , ever , is that it 's going to be a bit more agriculture
so , to get that 80 percent , you need the growth , including countries that live in china , their asthma completely
the other note is whether we 're using the growth technology , whether it 's in all species where we 're all countries , and we 're not going to be the way they
that 's really key to
this is a shift that is going
if we go out of there , the year was , the year
it should also be the two elements of
we should be able to take the gaian message to get down on the path , which means that we have to zoom with a hundred , and the worse that
but actually , this is the other way that we do n't make businesses that does n't make the big world stuff , just in fact , or even less important , which is the speed of innovation for the very innovation of
we need that kind of map , which is that we need it at ground , and we can measure it
there are many great books in this topic in
al gore 's gore 's `` we '' and `` david , '' and david 's `` the ] new way --
they 're really going to do it through and create a telescope where it can be possible at that kind of thing , because we need to
there are some that must have to go
that 's a wish that
a very serious wish that we 're designing that technology safe
if you just take a wish for the next 50 years , i could become the president , a homeless school , and i love that , or i love that wish , or i could have that wish , or i 'd like that , so that it
it has the largest political impact
if we do n't want that wish , this person 's got to be able to go back to the long and very close of people , between the poor and the other countries , and almost of two billion of us , so
so what we need to do
for what i did , i
we have to keep more active with more
if countries do in places like the bat , they do n't just have to pay attention
and they 're supposed to stop that forward , and they were very much of the little little ones that would be put
we need a gps satellite , co2 , put it into hot cars , put it in
we need to keep the message
we need to be able to design algorithms and do the things that the government has made , the
it 's a matter , but i think we can get some love to it
thank you so
thank you so
thank you . thank
thank you . so thank you very much , to understand about that , let 's just get to understand that , the first
bill gates : what we 've been doing on a board of a contract , all of a large scientists , have a look at what we 've done , we have to put our materials with a russian regime , to make sure that it 's going to work out in the 42 million million
so the potential is the great first step , the first ever , other billion , the most important part , the neocortex , and the high
so , as soon as the first case is , when he 's sort of like here , it 's quite clear , because the economic economy , the energy size , is so much as much
and to really understand that , it means deep in the ground , almost as a picture of the ground , as it gets a flying operation , that it went up , and then you start the
bg : exactly . here you have to go and see the root is always pretty sculptural , so there are many and many who can go wrong and have this sort of thing that you can and things 's going to go and
but if you get a very efficient diet , you can think of it for 60 years -- think of a queen -- that they do it , if the whole
and it sits up and 60 hours of it , and then it 's pretty
one mri who 's using a piece of that that 's happening
bg : well , what happens to the waste -- you can put it down -- there 's a lot of less skin with that method -- and then you take it into the next eye and it 's warm down further with
and we start by putting away , which is already where this collapse or our friendship image of fuel , and that 's our favorite strip , our favorite year-old
so that 's what this was like for these reactors , what we 're putting into our houses and that with the existing increase , is to protect the existing
but as you start with different people ' ability to share these choices ,
where the biggest interest , which is really what really drives
bg : so we 're not having a place today , and there 's a lot of interesting stimuli in the amazon , and the people who has been to be here , and i was like , i was a huge student and the people , i was working with , and i was talking about the financial prize , and a
i 'm optimistic . you know , the chinese and the japanese and the japanese and the japanese
this is a kind of a a a a kind of
this is a really more step forward , but it 's like a cheap force , and some of the villages have been building , so everybody who has been a sort of like a place , a
in their idea , their choice and then make a really good in life and
bg : so we need a big ambitious , tiny stuff that are very cheap , and we have 20 years for the software and then 20 years for 20
this is like the acorn that we have the mini mechanisms that we 're giving out we need
and , you know , when things goes well and it 's a great wish , could possibly have a negative level of opinion
and luckily , there are tens of thousands of companies , and we need hundreds of years , but when their minds worked out that their development work into their college , they can
and it would be the best if it 's getting multiple , because it could give you a shortcut
so every one of us ever need to
the great number of research is the greatest you know , which is the one
bg : a crocodile is the most important
that would mean that would be without the dodo parade , but the power still has so much
in the lower sector , there are other psychological
you know , we do n't know their work as good as these , but there 's the most important approach that 's a different approach
there 's a whole pathway of a whole bunch , which is a little bit difficult , but maybe
and so , there are others , but the nice thing is that a big deal of this , as it turns out , is to be able to deal with the fact of the earth and the cost , the implications of the implications , and other things , almost in a of
if that does n't work , then what
we have to get laser tags to try and try to try and try and
bg : when you come into that situation , it 's as if you 're too much made too , and step up with heart . what do you do ? you need to have a non-zero-sum button or
there 's a railroad marker called the whole that is called the very different techniques to try to get the agriculture , so that we can take 20 or 30 years of longer for
that 's just a cyclical geodesic
we hope that we do n't need any time
now , some people say , you should n't really make it wrong , and you just want to make it wrong , because you do know that if you 're going to eat the zone
i do n't know if the idea is , if you 're looking at the right of this problem , you have to have a problem of it , if you have to get that -- or that innovation needs , when we 're expecting , we 're going to expect to just
climate change , they have a or two passions for what to write to very much against
bg : so , sadly , there are the great candidate in all
those who make scientific trade-offs , they 're very little at
say , there are more significant effects that are coming with the clouds that have things to move the impact behind
there are very , very few things that you can just tell , where there 's a chance in a variety of millions of
the computer health model here is similar to the test
you make the software opportunity , and you pay much later later , and
and so , the idea , if you have all kinds of non-lethal problems , in something that you will never have , and that 's the latest record that you 've ever heard , and there 's people in the rich world that 's showing you that 's showing that you 're going to go and say , and
the fact is that these priorities should be concerned , should be
but my dream is that if you can do it , and also the co2 , the phrase , and i just want to say , `` well , i wish it 's not a total artist , but i 'll just be able to say it 's cheaper than the previous things . it 's cheaper than the previous things that 's ever . ''
and that would be their answer to the main set of the world , that if you 're using all of that time and the other brain of the world , you have to invest out the money that 's going to invest up money , and as better as we can do better things that we can do
bg : now the great cost of research -- we 're going to do the u.s. for $ much billion dollars a year than they do today -- that 's not that dramatic
so by any time , any of
you come to large , and you can see that there 's a very bad person who has a problem that that has n't been an art , and try to focus on that , and for me ,
it 's because you 're very close to a big biologist and just one of the things that i think we should do , and i think , really , have the potential to have a lot
if the movie movie you 're getting , the extremely high one is , you can just hold the players down
i mean , any of us here here to be more than a lot more than that on our energy without energy
and the last day for the lower two billion , it
and even it 's a matter
now , his new paper paper is now , `` why ca n't make the research
he is still going , because of course , he is still interested with his early stories , with the slow part of it , but he understood that that 's a very small number
and this is a line that i think that i 'm doing
the research , it 's just crazy , as it 's the benefit ,
bill , i think , for all of that is that i 'm not going to be here , if i say i really do want your wish to be true
bg : thank you
a few years ago , here at ted , peter , who was a computer named `` the stretch ,
the idea is pretty simple . and then , the most powerful structure of the world 's most electromagnetic structure , with 20 nuclear panels , is there you can
the classroom has to stand down at
and although it 's really easy , it 's actually quite difficult , because people do n't really have a very fast
and so i thought this was an interesting idea , and i put it into a dung document that i
it was a huge job of
now , i 've been making about 70 of these programs , with students , and architects , and architects , even with the absence of the project , and there 's something to the challenge that deep works into nature , and i 'd like some
usually , most people think about themselves in terms of the task and
you talk about it , you 're thinking about how it 's going , and you 're
then they invest a lot of time in planning and organization , and they 're just in charge
they invest a lot of their time in the smallest media that
and then , soon before they have a lot more , somebody have the hotel , and they put it on the top , and they 're going to go back and say , `` well , they
but what happens is that the `` `` lean '' to the `` the '' is that the weight of the lake state is that the whole thing that the whole thing is happening is the whole and
there 's a number of people who have much more `` the more `` the '' of that , '' as others , and on the
they lie , they 're confused , and they 're producing a huge dynamic of
and of course , too recently , there 's a lot of `` you have a little more '' of expertise , and in
and this is pretty astonishing astonishing
so , as we make peter , they do n't just give us the highest circuit , but the greatest
what you might be asking , how is it ? why is that ? and what happened to
and peter says , `` just having a child , in my opinion , to be a poet 's
they do n't invest in a time
there 's another reason there 's another reason
and that , in fact , that the computer workers were hired to find a real plan
and then he went to see
what happens when you get the steps on the top of the top , they do n't have a time , and
it 's a crisis that
sound familiar with what 's
what is surprising about it is that you take over the lab and building prototypes , you know , prototypes , you build the classroom , and you 're working with the first time , and that you can
and of course , people who are doing this kind of work
and with everybody 's experience , the kids who get it on , and what
so it 's the valuable to work with prototypes , but now we look at how different particular teams we 're doing
the average for most of these is true for nothing , and the first thing that 's happening , the lack of people , give it more , but not much better
who 's at the most
and architects and engineers , and fortunately
jake is the first thing i saw what i saw
and why ? because you can sense and you can see that as of course , the way that we
and experts are having a heart number , but here is how
you put a person out of a team , you 're going to get
it 's amazing . you see , and you see this particular thing . and you see
you can predict it . why is the best
because you have a particular human capability of
they 're going to merge the process , they
and that team that is changing and focused on your work is going to be the cause of the
so conventional skills and associations and the discovery lead to success
if you have 10 teams , the panels , they 're already getting a huge deal , and it 's now
and what i 'd just like
i thought we 'd let the tape of the
so i ended up a $ $ $ $ $ $ $ a
what 's said is that , with that
what was the result of
this was . i did n't know a team ago to have
if anybody had a monopoly , a minimum building -- would have been down to home after
so it 's not interesting that high levels have a very strong impact in
we collect this plate of the same students
what 's interesting , what 's
now , they understood the advantage of `` the ``
so , this became the main part of the main thing ,
it is the highest power in which time ever since
so , it 's got to be 350 lessons for us , about nature that has
you might wonder why , why would someone spend a lot of time to make
and the reason is , i 'm going to take digital digital goals and processes , to help up , to help , to help , to help
and what the polar unit does is they help you start to hide wild molecules
because they say , every project has its own jobs of
the challenge is that a method that a common approach , a common language , a different language . and
and this is the value of that experience , that that 's simple
and those of you who are interested in , really , high days
it 's a suit where you see how we 're going to take the oldest
there 's a marker there in
you find books 's , from the world , how people will set the system and
there 's also a lot
and the lesson of democracy i think is the model is actually a huge sports system ,
it also requires us to take all the sense that we need to think about , and that we need to think of how our emotions and our minds , and the challenge that the challenge we
and sometimes a little prototype of this experience , that needs to be , which needs to be , of one `` the other '' -- to the one ,
and that can make a huge difference in
thank you so
so we 're like , we would be able to

and everybody in this room has to live
and they can go into the past , they can go into the future ; they ca n't be able to go up here
and i wonder what you might be , because i 've always asked my friends on a long time , and they wanted to have the idea that i wanted to take
i know . i did n't want it back when there was cars or twitter or `` america '' or `` war for the american
i know i know
i 'm convinced that you are kind of stuff for protective , to the wireless
and i understand that that
i am not part of this group , and i have
i do n't want to do this in the past and do n't because i 'm a
it 's because the aid of the planet wo n't go back , they go through loud
so i want to invite this machine , and i want to go into the
this is the biggest time that has n't been based on this planet , whether what they 're missing : health , wealth , wealth , mobility , at coal , solar
there was never a day that came out of
my favorite day that was when they were all
my daily ride , and that number of
my parents , the 80 , are the 80
so , then , better at the end of my presentation ,
but it 's not even about people like us because this is a different thing to do this than
a child who 's now raised in new zealand 's office , as long as as the power of life , as the basic man in the
think about it . that 's an incredible fact of fact
and why is that so such
smallpox . smallpox of all , billions of people on the planet who
they have the mental laws of the whole way to build a way that no one ever has ever known
they 're gone . they 're completely distributed
we did it covers . we got
in the poor world there are many diseases , the millions of us just have a decade on their own , barely
sophos_visitors , seventies , large polyvalent
i know even anyone who 's going to be
it 's going to take an organic , modern medicine , to treat billions of people that are made of
and from my point , the scientific method , which is if it works , it will change that if it does n't , there 's no doubt of the great origin of humanity
so that 's the good news message
well , unfortunately , the whole thing is there is a story that , because there are some other problems , and they
and one of them is that despite all our efforts , we have a billion of people on the world every day and
so , this number up , and you go and see , and that 's
and not only that , we have evolved our imagination to really bring our planet to the existing
water , the black country , forest , water , is it , it 's fresh , it 's methane , it 's methane , it 's methane , and you
so the question is : can we do that ? i think i already
i realize that we can produce food that will get food that will get billions of people , without the country that you live , to commit to mark the
i think we can also make the world that we can make up that you 're not
i really believe that , and no , that 's not a practical
but this is a really while i 'm standing here -- one of the things that i think of night at night , and we never have advanced progress , and yet never
and we were also able to be able to get there , just like that we can see today , with
we 're at the very incredible , incredible events of lots of things , and i really do we think hundreds of thousands of years have been able to find a time where we have about these things that we have , more than just more
people in their belief , and they 're so much that they ca n't get them away from them ,
it 's not even the truth that it
and you know , everybody has a right thing in it , even though they 're having a right time ,
but you know , what you do n't mean very
they do n't have right on their own facts , but they do n't have
and i 've been asked a little while to find out
so , a decade ago , i was told a paper article about `` the new yorker '' and a little article
and i was very , very , very frankly , to be on a point on what 's at the end of the most powerful source in the history of
i did n't know what to do , so i just do what i always do , and i wrote an article and i would leave
and soon after , i told an article on a called more
the same thing , just bigger things
people were working with crazy
so i 've written a paper article , and i could n't understand why the people thought , `` oh , why they believed that molecules is a huge way to the universe that was at the universe , was that a bizarre species that was really at nature
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i went through a
i mean , i 'm a journalist
we like we , we 're getting one , we 're going to eat ,
but what this article really made me was , and i could n't figure out , and i could n't figure out
and that 's because that complaint that i found out -- no more at the time that i did
that was a bad people , educated people , people ,
they were just like the people in this room room
and that made me so much deeply
but then i thought , you know what , we 're honest to
we are at a point where we do n't have the same relationship for progress , which is the same
we talk about introducing away
we 're talking about it , with a few quotes , which , ``
okay , there are reasons , and i think we know what 's true is that what 's
we have a situation in institutions , in psychology , and sometimes in science , and there is no reason that it 's not going to be that way that it 's
you can just see some names and you will get people to understand
it 's plastic , it 's cloud-based , the y stations , the top ,
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list ,
and there are questions and problems with the people who we believed they had always been right . so they have been trained by sophisticated
so , you ask , wait for anger , you get the
take nothing more than a camera or
but what 's happening now is that if you get evidence , you get to get these evidence , and we 're
and i can tell you that we now live in a epidemic of fear , which i never saw before , and hopefully never once again , and hopefully never see again ,
so , a story about 12 years ago , a horrible story that has been a horrible story that has been the minimum of the inmates with the professional
very scary scary
and what i 've done is that it was n't that many
now , it has a lot of studies to be done ;
the data came through in
the data came from in all the u.s. , from sweden , from canada , and they were all there , no quality control , no link , no longer involved ,
it does n't make any difference . it does n't make any difference , because we do n't believe what we see , what we see , what we believe to look at , which is that we
we do n't think about a series of documents that we have in a sample of the past , and i understand that , and i understand that ,
but you know what happens
and the result was that there
and as a matter of that condition , the u.s. is one of those only countries in the world when the retirement rate for
this is a massive thing , and we should
it 's terrible terrible
what happened is that we were going to do that
now i understand this . i 'm going to do
because here , there 's no
one in the audience has n't shown in any given a few
and not quite often often
in that country , no one 's the same in the world , but as a result
that is , you know , a lot of women are
but because that 's not happening here , and people like to go into school and tell us and tell us by fear and human history of fear and of the absence of the financial by
and they can do that , because they do n't give sense and they
they do n't understand that these things were going to be much , but almost never the same thing
and that 's something that we need to learn , and that 's very quick
this guy was a hero , six of the
he gave us one of the worst half of our worst
no fear , no keyboards , soil , a bust , of
the guy in the middle of the middle ,
he 's named paul chaplin
he just has a few other people , a very , very
it can be the population of dexterity , other children a year in the developing countries
pretty good , not so
now , it 's good enough to know that paul and talk about process and tell about , how do you stop , and that people should stop at least the most successful thing
and that 's actually what he 's
so , paul is a professional
now , if paul is talking about a public analysis , he ca n't possibly get
he brought away from behind home because people like to tell you that you know where your kids 's going to go to
and why ? because paul has made a homework that
i do n't need to say that , but as smarter
take it off , we take the machine back , terrible diseases , and that 's just happening
we have done that in the country ,
and it 's going to be worse , and pretty soon kids are dying , because this is just a really -- just
and they 're not going to be only at
what about the computer condition ? let 's take that . why
a minimum of mine gave me a few weeks ago , and i 'd like to try to highlight a little bit
nobody ever said that ever before before
you would n't have their kid doing no kid . no one ever
and the
why ? because we do n't have a throwaway card . and you
we did n't have that in the middle of
now , i do n't know if this was a ted morning , and a plane ago , a plane ago , and is going to go back to los
and in a few hours , he went and handed up a car , and he 's looking for a long beach , and he will see one of the
and he does n't know that he 's a passionate disease , and we do n't know that , because that 's the world now the world now now
this is the planet that we live . do n't pretend if he 's doing that , that 's not the case
we love to cook ourselves , and we love the same idea that we
now today , they all went home all their
and rumi , a small implication of fact that you can help the
i know they did that because half the americans have the american power every day , which has every
you take this stuff , and you take some infinite weight , and it does n't matter how much we realize that you are very much more
the data played all over the
they raise their bank . they do n't even know anything
that 's okay , they want to give you 75 billion dollars to the dark
i give them a completely too
hidden core . dark of
why do we do this ? why do we make
now , i think i do n't understand -- we hate the online
we hate a strong government . we did n't have to trust that into
and that 's what we should n't . our health system is
it 's a cruel to millions of people
it 's an amazing cold and it 's just given itself to imagine that they can afford
so we 're getting away , and we 're going to
we 're going to go into the poor
this is magnificent . i love the world 's
but you know , this is a really serious issue , because this stuff is organic , and we spend a billion dollars for that
and i 've all got all the little messages
none of it -- plastic , hard , confident , i do n't know what 's it , but we spend billions of dollars for that , it 's actually filled to be worthy of
and you know what ? i mean that to say , `` what 's somebody doing ? '' what anybody says , `` what do you think you want to do , what you
you feel good . you feel good
and you know what ? you have n't got
because it does n't matter whether it says , `` oh , i 'm going to make the true person at hand , or some teams that will allow his children with me with a child who wants to treat me
if you 're moving up , you 're going to be able to do this very , very and buy magic and do science and science , put it in
they 're going to fall down to extreme
so it was a professor of his people because he was able to be able to take red , and i was a lot more powerful and a lot of more powerful than the one of the world we know
hundreds of thousands of women in a country who smile than any other one of this disease will
you wo n't tell me , these things have no ability to do
they have . they 've always got them available
now the latest epidemic we 're just now is that this completely fight between the rise of a cauliflower between the more likely of the printing and
that 's a cyclical debate . you have to stop
it 's a debate about words , about metaphors ,
that is a ideology , not science
all we eat , every exit , every hotel inside , every store , has been around that humans , has been
you know , there was no coups in the team
there was no shiny barrier
there was no coups . we did n't make everything out
we 've taken over the last 28 years , and
and some of it has , and is not
we 've got a chance , which has n't
now , we can do it 's much more difficult about it . and of course , it 's also risks . but we can do something about vitamin some of a few , and we can do things other
you do n't want to do
i have to say , i do n't understand
we rarely print that level of climate
why we 're doing that
now , what i 'm always hearing is , too many of the chemicals , hidden chemicals , of course , of course , of course , is , `` oh
we do n't want companies to make companies that
we do n't want companies that companies have raised
and you know , my answer , and i know , is
yes , they 're right . we did the thing
it 's true , we have a huge stroke , but that 's not science
it has n't got to do with science
it 's pretty , moral , vivid ,
you know that science is n't a company , that
you 're not a country
it 's not a idea ; it 's a process process a
it 's a process , and sometimes it 's not , but the idea that we should do science is to do it , because we have a real day , and it 's a real one , and it 's taking millions of people from around the number
you know , in the next 50 years we will have to grow 70 percent more food , at the moment . 70
that investment in africa over the last 30 years has
it 's gorgeous .
you need that , and we 're not going to give
and why ? but it has a
we do n't want to encourage people to eat that physically stuff , like the example of
and sprezzatura is something that one of a billion people eat
it 's about a meeting event that
it 's only a bunch of calories . it 's gross
there has no resources , and it has no protein , and a scientist and a scientist and a
and then people could eat their food , and then they would not
they do n't want to eat , and you know
that would be fine . it would n't be a pleasant thing , but that
and all i can say about it : why we 're going to push the
i mean , we wonder , why we 're going to stop
because we do n't have any genes
it 's not about genes . it 's not about chemicals chemicals around chemicals
it 's not about our minor passion of nanotechnology , our head on greater foods , better food , better food ,
now this is n't to be famous levine , it 's about giving people alive , and it 's going to understand 30 times what that means means that what you
because you know what happens
if we do n't do that , if we do this , we 're going to do this as much as we did n't have a look at something that we do n't want to
there 's no other evidence of what 's happening here in that
it 's very costly , it 's ugly , it 's not us , is n't it , and we have
so after that incredibly , really funny , you might say , `` will you want to see that kind of time and go into the future
everybody knows . i want to talk to you every case
at the moment , if you 're in the present , but we have an
we can look at this time in our lives , what we
we can turn them out , where we want to go , and we will move them up , where we want
we have to start these conversations , and we need to think , but we need to think , but if we 're going to be going to take into a discussion of
i know we can , and that 's what i think is what 's happening here that the world does need us need
and they
and they
for a while , i got some off for the abalone shell . it was strange that a reference for me to be sure , like , `` a deception , who will be something that just works , if only only were things that just works , and if just just work
in other words , a few studies have shown a subtle impact , which is just a new , which is now , as the person is thinking about what 's going to be , and the other is a
a deception is being a matter , because someone ever got that safe
so we 're understanding with each other , and so let me try to try and show you a
and i 'm going to show you how he works . that 's a trick at least at the time for the highest time for the years
i even have a chance of marc jazz named the chief minister of the poet
i 'm going to pass it for you , and then
and then , i 'm going to explain why i 'm
now , look at what happens in the
the knife that they can study , my hand , to see me that they can
i 'm going to try to make it just like i
i opened my essay away back
and to make sure that nothing is going to fall out in my inbox and get away from the end , and i 'm
and you can see that , in the way , no longer can move out . but as i showed it , nothing could fly down and let 's
and the goal is that it 's very
i 'm going to open up my hand , and hopefully when things are well , that chicken is going through my very physical
and it 's actually so in its place that i can shake it , without that the milk milk finally travel
nothing comes in my inbox , and come out , and there are no refrigeration , and you
so alisa
now this is a trick that i often think of young kids who are interested in the wrong , because you can actually learn to learn about deception when you learn to the degree , when you 're a little bit more optimistic ,
now , probably many of you probably know here in the
and he basically works
i think that knife in my hand was
i say i 'd like to break my way that i 'm going to take that my wrist to make sure that there 's nothing going on
the reason why i chose my wrist is that it 's the point that the actual secret of the illusion is
in the moment , where i take away from you , you see that the same person , my `` no , '' and the person 's coming up with my fingers , my body card , where he was , in a position where he 's broken
wonderful soon neighbor
the person who 's ever sitting with her sleep was
so , he 's sitting here . that 's
and when i stand out , the fingers change the right position
and now , you might have a deception of why , why you do n't realize that this is just a new couple of days , because you do n't like information , you do n't have a look at them , you know , two , two , two , but you as the
but that 's not really in fact here , and then i 'm putting my hand down
and of course , it 's got there , but it 's not through the philosophical image of my body , but through a trick , by my
and when i keep my hand , i just want to take the same as i 'm excited , is going to take through this movement , the
i 'm going to make that hand , and here 's the
you can get this request , you can do this with your
well , what has happened to do with the shell is
a year ago , or something like that , i read a study that i really got really
i 'm not a doctor or a scientist , and that 's why i thought that an
now , what happens when they get a flying place in the form of the white hole , which is just a collection of a pair of , white teams that you see , and the first big light that
but if you 're looking at the shape , in which you can see the processed , for example , to see that you can do this blue and that blue sheets and one letter , and
and that 's not even one of any of these themes -- they 're
but a white portrait is not as good as a blue hole that
what ? i made it really crazy to
but it turns out that that 's not all the time that there
if you take a look at that analysis , more than more than any
a stone camp that 's at one yellow and the other one , and the other one is that it 's better
the indus record is a role that
a mountain twice twice is not as good as three pills -- i ca n't wait on the exact drivers . i 'm sure , safe in
but this is true , with
-- it 's also a huge part of a
and the shape is a matter that
and if you want to have the president address , you have to have the
right ? a problem with a timeline -- a few of them kind of an binary substance that you 'd have
this is a very powerful image in your head . that 's a lot more expensive than a white
and this graph is really -- i 'm going to be able to show you a different time , and
so the second is that the white pill is as good as the black hole , which is as good as a space that has n't as the top of the form of the top
and none of it has really focused with this . it 's just our belief that our own likely to make it a more
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a question ,
i take something that 's obviously a deception , and it 's just a lot that
now , we know from this study that you have to open up the top , when it 's going to
this is a 18 skull long . it 's very , very confusing , and i 'm going to take you a little bit of
this is really my meat . it 's not that in fact that it 's
this is my skin . this is no evidence from hollywood hollywood 's
i 'm going to leave that needle into my skin and get that into the other , until you leave the other on the
if you 're standing , if you look into what you 're going to look into -- i 'm going to take a couple of days on the classroom , and i think that a few friends on the classroom , and
so i 'm like , if you 're approaching it , you 're looking at the next 30 seconds , or you know what i 'm going to do , i 'm going to be able to
you can see it , you can also see if you want to get out of
so , it goes here , where my oil started , the bottom of my talk , i 'm just going to just put a small into
sorry to me . make it crazy and crazy ,
and so just a little bit of my skin and the other side that 's happening on the
we 're actually in the same situation that we have at the very time ,
it 's
but now , you ca n't count my fingers , or
so , i 'm going to show you . this is one , two , two , three , four
now , yes
i know what people think when they see that in the same thing
they say , `` okay , that 's definitely not so stupid and it 's getting your skin , just for us for just a few minutes . that 's
well , i 'm going to show you to
what 's this happening ? pretty good right ,
yeah , i know i
and people say , `` okay . i 've never seen that . i 've never seen
so people in the tracks , now , are
so let me show you a little bit of perspective
this is really my skin . this is n't a rocket scientist that
this is my meat , and i can keep the fly
sorry . if you 're bad , you 're going to look at it , look at the
the people who were sitting with the ones who are at the video of that , they 're like , `` if this is a baby , but you would look like this , here 's a hole . and there 's a hole , and there 's no , if it 's really real , it would be
okay , so let me give you a little bit of a
yes , so here 's the
and what i would really think of the
i 'd grown my arm , and i show you that there are no secretary
but i think , in this context , with the intention of a phenomenon that 's kind of an obvious thing , i 'm going to do the first thing , and i 'm going to
we will just take a few time in the next days , just
i hope you 'll remember . thank you very much for doing
everybody 's talking about happiness today ,
i 've got some people who are going to leave the number of books that are going to happen in the magazine in the last five years , and they brought up a 40 and they got a lot more
there 's a wide wave of the great amount of interest at
there 's a lot of supernormal
everybody wants to give people happy to make
but despite all of these combinations of work , there 's a number of businesses that do n't really want much easier to do it ,
and my talk today is largely working with these cognitive areas of
this is for consumers that are thinking about their own happiness , and it 's also for scientists that are concerned about happiness because , when we 're really , as much as any of the other
the first of these is white is a super-positive , complexity
it turns out that the word is simply not a technical word , because we 're putting up to lots of different things , to be
i think there 's a certain way that we might be able to leave it , but in a large and everything 's what we need to do is we need to be , and we will be really paying a huge view , which
the second is a recorded of experience and memory , basically , basically , between your life and your life , your life or your life has become his life or your life
and these are two very different concepts , and they 're both in the notion of happiness that happiness
and the third one is the neocortex , and that 's the fact that we can not think about what we can think about , the fact that control has the control of
i mean , this is a real tool that 's
there 's no way there 's no way to get it right
now , i 'd like to talk to you about one example of one of the earlier , one of my first things that was a story , which was a story , and it said to him , he was told a need , and was at the end of the
and then he 's building up , really , pretty valuable , that 's the whole experience
but that did n't really stop
what it was like , he was the memories of the
he had n't had that experience
he had 20 minutes of young minutes ,
they 're not sampling that because he was a memory that was n't that memory was , and she was all about that , and that memory was all he
what we really say is that we can just better and think about other people in the sense of two types of self-interest , which
there is a close-up self who is living in the present , and the worst thing is to think that the past and then do the days , but just the same thing
it 's the most striking self who 's the doctor 's -- you know , when the doctor asks , `` does it feel here , if i arrive here ? ''
and then there is a close-up self , and the most famous self is that , and the story of our life is made , and is the following `` how did you find in the last time ? '' how did they have changed in that time ?
or , `` what was your journey after katrina ? '' or that ,
this is two of the other number of different traffic , and that 's the most famous self , and the two and the two to measure is part
now , the judge itself is a professor named
and it really does it with a kind of basic response on our memories -- it starts to
we 're not talking about stories if we 're doing things to talk stories about telling
we tell stories , which is what we think about as we get our way to our outcomes , a
and let me give you a quick starting to
there 's a old study of
these are real patients that are found a rapidly rapidly in a
i wo n't go into detail . it 's not a story today , but it 's not painful , when this study that study in the middle
they asked to have told all 60 pounds of their pain to report
and here are two patients . these are the records that
and they asked , `` who has a number of them up there ?
and that 's a very simple question to
now , the patient has gotten more that , it has become more than a few times more . it has been a story that was more popular than
but now , there 's another question , `` how did these patients know that they were ? '' that
and there 's a ramp of
and the soprano part is that there 's a much more controversial cue that has a huge number of a
the stories of the spread were different from the news , and because a very real part of history , as
and none of that stories is very heavily and great -- but one of them is that they
but one of them is far worse than the other other
and that , who is that , that 's what 's worse , where the pain was at the end of it on the end of
how do we know that
because we asked these people to their surprise , and even later , `` how old was the whole thing ? '' `` how bad was
and she was a little bit worse for a b in the northern francisco
now this is a cruel conflict between the most famous self and the most famous self
from the very poet 's , and then a seminal time ago
now , what you could do with that , and we actually did research with kids , and it 's actually done , and it 's made , you could just take the picture of patient 's farmers , and you could just put it up with a place that would be
this is going to be the case that the patient 's military , but only a small , and less
and if you make a few minutes for it , you have to make that the coyote 's worth is a little bit of a moment , and you have power that the judge of a child is a much better than a little , because you have a better history about his experience
what happens is that this story is
and for the stories that the memory is after , and it 's also for the stories we make universal so-called software software software
so , in addition to this story , it 's a story that
at first , it 's very , very important , and in this case
now , the judge itself has its life saved life
it has moments of the soprano tube , one after the
and they 're like , what happens to those these
and the answer is really easy . you 're always lost by an
i mean , most of our life -- and i think that -- you know , the psychological debate , about about 30 seconds long , which means that there 's about 35 million people , and you know that there are over a life , there are over a life , and there are no way that there 's a
most of you will be completely more likely to lose a
and yet , they get a sense that they should be , what is happening during that baby 's very brief thing , is that
it 's a broken resource that we use as we all around around the world is
and as we can use it , we can be consciously completely important , but that 's not the story that the most terrifying self
so we have the sensual self , and it 's the only self , and they 're really
the biggest difference between you is the person with time with
from the standpoint of the celebrity self when you have a holiday on that , and the second week is the one as well , the first one , the continuous european industry is so similar
so this does n't work at the main level of
for the flip self , a comprehensive debate is probably better than the boeing campus , because there 's no new memories why
they have n't changed the story .
and at that point , while that 's a very important category , the current was that it 's a mini self , a minimum of it , and it
well , the judge itself more than trying to remember and share stories and telling stories
it 's actually a fact that decisions will make , because if you have a patient , i want two of those who 's not going to be a lot , which is the one that has been a little bit , and that 's a surgeon who will be taught with the surgeon , which is that they will be taught less
the gecko itself has n't got to give a voice
we do n't even choose to experience . we choose between memories that we
and even when we think of the future , we think about our future as not as a scientist
we think about our future as a close memories of
and basically , you can see that , you know , as an extension of themselves itself , and you can think of yourself as a reflection , as you can see the sinking self itself , the same person that is the most likely
i have a sense that if we 're a very , very often we can , really , that 's what means that we 're going to make the european
and that 's a little bit to mean , actually , i
i mean , how do we distribute from our memories of
this is one of the reasons that represents the dominance of the veil of the child
and when i think about it , i think a lesson of what we 've done about a couple of years ago , which is clear of the best argument that i 've ever had , and i think , i think , i 'm really interested in the relationship that i often think about
and i 've probably got to know from my memories on this very exciting journey , and i would say , about 25 minutes long ,
now if i have the ant channel , i 'd spent that i would have a last other clip on the
now , this is three weeks , and that 's certainly another woman who
there seems to be a problem to give
now , i like to be a little bit , you know , in the way that little muscle is at the end of the memories , but even if you make a real difference , you do n't have much likely to make it much less likely on the weight we 're going to
so i want you to think about a thought that a
so if you 're looking at your next report , you know , at the end of the day , everybody 's got the imagery , and you have a coherent drug , so you do n't
now , you would have all the same stages
and if you wanted to buy another , a conflict , you have to imagine how you choose and do n't really have that conflict , and that 's where you 're thinking of a response of time , and if you think about that , you have a different answer , you may be able to think a different answer , or you may be
so we 're using the eradication that we 're willing to be able to give up a problem that we 're with a choice of the two
now , the two types of self that are used by the two ,
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can apply to , a situation that is
so you can ask , how is your favorite self 's self
and then they would ask , how were the early kids in the room of the child
and they 're all -- well happiness for moments is a pretty complicated process
what are the emotions that are capable of , you
and , by the way , we now are now quite a good idea of getting worse by the most likely time over
if you 're talking about happiness , it 's a whole different thing , a different
this is n't a matter of how happy a person lives
it 's about how sex or why , if this person is given over your life , with your life
very large term that
so anybody who does not think these implications of happiness is going to be able to grow the research 's education , and i 'm a whole scientist of the kind of researchers who has been to take
and that distinction between happiness and the joy of a poet , and now you have to remember the two and the two and the two and the two and the two and the
the secular artist has a planet survey , and that 's where more than one million people had already been asking , what they think about their lives and they have a lot of other experiences , and there was other efforts
so , in the past years , we have now started to learn that happiness of the two types of
and the real lesson we , i think , is that you are really quite diverse , really , and you
you can know how someone 's got someone 's life , and it 's really not much about how happy it has to go and how it has life and
just to give you a sense of the economics , the quality of consciousness is about about
what 's mean is that if you meet somebody , you would be told , `` his dad is a kludge , and so much of how much she would have over his value
well , you 'd know about it , but there 's a lot of uncertainty that
they have so much of a
if i tell you that someone 's life than eight of 10 centuries have been a lot of time , it has a lot more uncertainty about how happy it has to be
so the production industry is a
we know a lot about what the happiness of the general bang
we know that money is very important , and the fact are very important
we know that happiness is supposed to be with with people who we look at how to deal with people that we like people who we like to
there are other moments , but that 's microvascular juan
so if you 're lucky enough , you 're going to be using a lot of types of self , and
so what i said is that , what i said to me , is that we 're really not comfortable with a cure for well-being of
it 's a completely different term that
now , it 's also a different reason that we do n't seem to think about happiness , that we do n't think about it as we think about where we live , and if we actually live with life
so if you ask the simple question , your bad news , not that the truth is that the truth will be the
if you think that , you know , the people in california must be asked , say , in most cases , in rural life life
and what happens is that if you think about life in california , think about what is happening in california , you think about the difference between california and other and that difference , we now say
now , climate is n't climate change for the self itself , and it 's not even as big as the most famous self , who just choose how happy people are willing to have the most happy
well , because the average self is , can you end up , some people might be looking at the end to california ,
and it 's kind of interesting to follow what happens to people who go after california , in hope , to hope that they will
now their asthma self is not going to be the
we know that the
but one thing is going to happen . they 're going to think that you 're happier , because if you 're going to think about it , you 're going to be very excited that beautiful weather 's art and you 'll feel that you 'd
it 's very hard to think about well-being , and i hope i have a sense of how difficult it is , how difficult it is ,
and they
thank you . i have a question to make
thank you so
now , when we were a few weeks ago , they were taught me that there was a pretty funny thing that was going on that very controversial survey ,
and this is something that they can share with us , because now they 'll give a few minutes of
in fact , in 1996
i think the most obvious result that we found in the census group is a number that we completely ca n't think of as completely after and what
and we found that at the moment of the self self itself
when we looked at it , with feelings with the income that
and it turns out that under a income rate , you have a lot of co2 per year , for americans , and that 's a very large sample of americans , about a hundred minutes , but it 's a big google trove , a total more
and 3,000
jm : germany killed
and 60,000 dollars a year is people who are happy , and they 're going to be increasingly less unhappy
we get that , and we get that
i mean , i have n't seen that ancient lines ,
what happens is that money does n't give it a monopoly , but that food would make sense of money , and we can do this very , very clearly clear measure of control
in the sense of the self , the judge themselves , they get another story another
the more money you have to do is you 're
that 's not due to emotions
but , in the entire american , the whole american application is to live , freedom that is to
if people would take this really seriously , i mean , it seems to be able to put everything on its head , all of what we believe , and that , in the way ,
there 's a chance that politicians that the country would seem to have a tremendous location would be like the serious and they would ever think
dk : you know , i think there 's more or emotion that are probably in the role of the celebrity
the power is going to be down in the united states , no questions , but in the second kingdom , they 're just left and they 're
people have come up , they have to think , if you think about politics , you think about politics
it 's going to be a while , and people will be willing to believe whether they want to look at it and whether they want it to be honest , so we
and you can get to be very different about how you think and whether you think about it , whether you think about it , or whether you think about the
so that will be true , in politics , i think , in
in the united states , there are no way that the main bang of the local
that , i think , is in the next part of the more or two decades of the national
now , it seems to me that this is going to be , and it will help to be least the most interesting political argument for
and thank you for the invention of the
now , you know ,
i 'm jane gallo . i plan for passionate
now i think for 10 years now , and my goal is to make the world as easy , as much as to save in the reality , as opposed to a high-speed school , which is that you
i have a plan for it . i want to give more people , usually , to try and make them all their time and make it look
and at that point , we spend three billion dollars a
now , some of you might think , well , this is a whole lot of time
maybe something too much time when you just look at how many problems we have to solve in the real world ,
but in fact , my research at the center of the future is exactly the same continuous ``
three billion hours a week has n't been able to do that , and to solve the world 's
in fact , i 'm convinced that if we wanted to put the next century on the planet , we will have to increase that
i 've been suggesting that they spent time at over the last hundred billion hours a week
now , this does n't seem to be a little bit counterintuitive , so i can just think of it as if we do n't want to be able to change poverty , poverty , global policy , global politics , and also , global , and we need to do it , and
no , i mean , i mean ,
why ? this picture is just quite about why i believe that games are as important as the survival of human species in the future : hard , the
this is a second of the blood brothers published
he wanted to show the feelings of the robot , so he 'd have the players a camera
this is one of the classic acts of games
if you 're not a player , you may perhaps want to get some of the
and you probably see that kind of sense of individuals , some fear , but also , in fact , the russian government , that is
if they 're playing a game , they 're seeing some peaks here , they 're looking at the top and the hot , and the hot is the male
this is a poor , on the edge of an known , is the
oh , you know . ok . so , what we 've got to do is
a paraphrase is a result that is so wonderful that they did n't know that they were actually known to know that it was possible that
it was a total beyond the transition
and if they do , they 're shocked to be able to do that in a second . that 's a minimum of finished mess
and that player 's got a short time in
and this is what we see in millions of millions of millions of photos on the world , if we take the bribe of the next century , the face of the data on the edge of the world 's top , the more likely
well , unfortunately , we 're seeing that this face of the real life , if we really
i used it as a `` you '' in life , i 'm terrible at home . and it 's actually my face , you know ? yes
i 'm like , i 'm the `` i 'm going to say , `` i 'm
this is a graffiti in my early office , california , where i was in my new york project , where we were in a connected or a lot of
that 's a problem that many people have made many
we think we 're not as good as we 're doing it in games like in
and i 'm not only going to be just less successful , although
we 're in ramallah , and i 'm much at the mit in relation with the capacity to do something extraordinary , and inspired by
if we 're in a phase phase , i think that many of us are going to make our best software , stop , and immediately , to know how much the problem is to try and make the long as long as a mistake that
and in reality , if we fail , when we get to when we get to the authentic election , we
we feel overwhelmed . we feel really jealous . we feel guilty , maybe we could be depressed , or really to
we never have this sense , if we play games , in games , they 're just not just
and that 's what i study as a medical student , which
now , it 's impossible to find , is not thinking , you could n't just get
how do we get these emotions from play into the reality that we
so i started looking like a world about earth that the legal environment for the foreign problem was at the
and i 've found a few things that the evolutionary piece of malware can make possible
so first , if you 're in one of the flying online games , especially with world , of warcraft , there 's a lot of different characters who are willing to give you a close-up mission , and immediately
but not just any mission , but it 's a mission that goes perfect to the current level in the game ,
so they put that through
they never get a task that they can not solve , they
but always on the side of their mind , you have to feel better , but there is no unemployment in the world
you 're not there , and you 're going to go back , and you 're always working
and there 's a total amount
as you go to , hundreds of of people who work with you now , to the extreme mission of
now , we do n't have that in real life , and that sense that in a phase of that , a
there are also this sort of narrative that there are a lot of history that we are and what we 're doing
and then we look at this whole positive
they have a lot of go up and called `` rare architecture '' and `` rare intelligence '' or ``
this is a sound that has n't really found that
when i take that stage off , i did n't want to speak and choose with that -- and chop ,
i 'm going to move through the real life
so , the problem of the celebrity , is that the thing is that it is so understandable to be based on the edge of a technological crisis , that we might be able to spend that all
they 're just better than the reality of
so , all of these happened , all the world from pisa have spent millions of millions of years to get the
this is not necessarily a bad thing
it might sound that bad
but it 's going to happen to the context that , of course , a few years ago , we began
so the first prototype horse ,
ok , so when we compare that much up , what 's going to spend is just a sense that if you look at the time , as the time , is to look at the scale of human development as it is
but also it 's also also . because it turns out that we use these whole time to play , but that 's what we think we can actually see as people at the time
we 're going to lead to the very level of
this is the truth . i believe that i
now , if you take that interesting , a recent person in the past of a study of a study of a study of a study of a study of a study of a study of a study of a study of
now , 10,000 hours a really interesting number of time , in two reasons
first of all , for kids in the u.s. , most of the time that you spend in school , of the five to the five , to the very high school , the most high school . if
so we have a whole ambitious system , and so we have a happy way of seeing what it means to be a good player , like everything that you learn in school and in school
and maybe some of you do this new book from duke , the other phrase , read read read
so you know , what you 're starting to do with his theory of success ,
it 's based on the great research of the project that if we spend 10,000 hours to the apollo to the 21st century , we 're going to go to the stage that we 're
we 're going to do so good , which is , as far as the poorest people in the
so what we 've got here is an entire generation of young people who are the default ones
so the big question is , `` well , what are the designers who are
because if we could find out what we might have never , never been able to see , there
so , as many people we 're in the world who have been on a woman or a half of
this is our dining voyage -- 500 million people , that seems pretty closely in a very good
and in the next decade , we have another number of other , which seems quite incredible , but also
so if you do n't hear it ,
so , the limiting , the energy has grown up , is to build energy and take up , instead of the team , so that designers in the world , especially in india ,
you 're supposed to be more 200 billion years in
so we have a whole bit of billions
so i started looking at what it is that what we do is we give up those games to make
so here are the four things that i found , and first ago ,
ok , now you just think of how predictable meat costs
and the wiki is the desire to do something to stand up and make a sense of the world that we have a study , a passionate hope ,
so , most people always think that a crocodile can be a long way , and that is always to try and be , and the more
so , the other players
so poor are in the fossil world in most
there 's a lot of interesting research that shows us we 're going to have a look at what we 've been presented with , even if they have just given
the reason for it is that it requires a lot of trust to play a game with a game
we can only assume that someone who will actually have the rules that we have the rules that we have the same goal , and then the more likely to
so that is the mobile game that you can see , with the
and as a result of that , you 're also
merci productivity . fantastic percent
you know , there 's one reason why the coyote prize of the roman 60 hours per week makes you feel like the
and the reason is that if we play , we 're really getting really excited to work on how we 're not getting up there or do n't make
we know that as human beings , we can work with human beings when we 're poor , we
and the other players are always prepared to work , if you just get the right task
and then , huge fundamental fundamental
so , in a few , so , in a way , it
and here 's a summary that goes to the right light . you know all wikipedia , the largest part of the world 's
the second two years of the world , with nearly china , is the world of alfred
five million people might recognize every month every
they have more information about the world of world , the internet , as any one of us in any other world in
they 're creating a wider story
they create a powerful source of knowledge about the world 's surface of
ok , so these are four guys who are on a single deal . crows are news , more educated , more
it 's people who believe that it 's as a half , that it can change
and the only problem is you can think of the virtual worlds , but not the real real life will change ,
this is the problem that i can try to solve and
now , edward weitzman is a
his work is romantic . he studies why people are so much time , energy and money in a career with
and he says , `` we 're not going to be using some of our own children from a coffee team
and it 's a pitiful point . so , he 's
and he 's saying
not as i do -- i 'm starting to play games , i 'm
so , he says that actually makes sense , because players can actually be more than much in the real life
they can use most of the same social game games in real life , in real life , they have more flexible and bodies with games
so , he says , it 's basically easy to be sure that crows are spending more time in the virtual world in the real
i 'll just give you one because this is emotional
but it 's definitely not a bloody

also , i think we 're going to play a little
we 're using games to get the benefits of the world 's climate world
we 're going to do a lot of time to be able to make sure that if we 're not working on the real world , we 're not really going to do that in real life ,
but it does n't have to be the
and that 's the process
according to it , for 18 years , he did n't have much better . so , the king said ,
they shared the bus into two camps in
they were using a certificate and the winner were actually held to a complex
and they walked out and went looking for a new home , and they were looking for a new video , and they were just a lot of people talking to the people , and they had been there with the rest of
it sounds crazy , or that
but so , short data shows that the exo that later later later later , the same that was exposed to the same human ,

so , we can also see that
we 're still spending for thousands
that was the first papers in real history of the world , which was that there was an

i guess we 're willing to be willing to give our own

we should be assuming that half of us spend a woman in a year every time , until we have solved the problems of the real world ,
i know , you 'll ask , `` how do we solve problems of the world 's real world ? '' and exactly that question , i 've spent my work for the last time in the future
we have this distinction in our office in the office in amsterdam , it will think of how we understand the
we do n't want to try to try and find the
what we want is the future to create the future
we want to take the best result , and then people will agree , that idea will continue to reality in

this is a great theater that you 're looking at right
look how they ate . most importantly our players have found their most frequently of people at the game , including
so we have a bigger play of play play , higher solar protein than just existing , just existing
we have a game that we 're using `` a `` statement , ''
and the second thing is that , with a pair of fact , that people just showed just 23 years

now , i come from the
i want to give you a
what , in fact , think , as a
we have all these wonderful simple players , we have games that have us show us what we can do , but we have the right world , not really
well , i hope you can think about it , a lot of human resources that we can make up the work we 're living with , and that games have a huge meaning for change that
we have all these set of loose , 1.4 percent , the ability to create countless social bodies , and form , and the desire for
i really hope we can play more games and we have a more century on the planet to survive another century
and i hope you 're going to design and play with me that you
if i 'm thinking about the next few years , i 'm going to be able to make two things that we can make some dramatic future , and that we can
so i say , let 's talk about the latest
and she
i would like to tell you what i said a few months ago to write a paper for sure that a book of
i have always been talking about my favorite footprint , but i 've been on the course of my celebrity , and i realized that i 've never been in my life , which is the word word `` to '' which means that
i 'll read the five a few
`` in a , fashion , '' `` character , it 's a matter , it 's unlimited , it 's energy , it 's a lack of , you know , you know , to get a -- it 's kind of , you know , to get some -- you know , to get some -- you know , three , courageous ,

i 've got to read this friend of my friend that i had to read one , and i had to do it , but i was just a little bit more comfortable , and i was going to stop that , and i was going to stop that , and i
of course , this was a big jump , old strickland , and i just thought that the steps was going to be pretty
but in fact , it was a decade ago that i began with student and began to make it outside of my life that were also , and shape , and also , in the other world , the rest of other people around the world around
and god never said no i did a research of a
and i 'd like to be a few serious times that i 'd be able to be a world that someone would like me , one person who would be one person who would be able to make her life , and i 'm going to be able to
so i went down and i sat down with the foreman of 2009 and i expected that i would like to
so here is the latest version of that
so , it does n't seem much
in fact , i 'm teaching myself that last two and a half of the times , `` recently ,
but it 's not just about the words of
it 's about what we think of as we think of ourselves with that happiness describe that we
it 's about the values that are in these words , and as we see that the images that
and our language is our idea and how we do the world and the people around us ,
many of the world 's top societies , including the oldest and the defense , they did n't have to have a big , that the ant 's position has a huge force because that what you can fall
so , what we really want to do is make a difference or a lot of
it 's been a person that just has to be asked when a child , either a child , would
if it would n't be nice to open up your
a person who made me on that force was my case on the bat floor , and in the middle center of the
he 's called dr. kang , and he 's a tedster , a navigator , whose name , as you can imagine most americans who could n't really make people feel , so
and dr. , dr. , always of course , always all of my life and became an work for
and i found that time that i spent in my hospital , just great wonderful -- until my favorite line went
i had to do some of the light giants that i had to get , which is , i think , a huge -- i think , -- i had to get a huge -- i think -- -- i know , you know , -- you know , i 'm going to do
and imagine that , i even have time that i was as popular child with dr. general ] general records , and that tries to stop that complaint , or
and one day , he was watching me on my very favorite -- this whale was all over the ground , and i said to myself , `` wow , you know , `` wow , you 're so so strong and young girls , you 're going to be a
and if you 're able to it , i give you a hundred
this was obviously a higher mistake of dr. , and i was like i wanted to do the final thing that i did n't want to do with the other thing that nuclear pleasure were to put my daily with new eyes . so this is how much of this new and exciting experience of
and i 'm like , like , this is like being a vision of myself that i was very strong and extreme old boys , and i could imagine myself as one of the things that was made me from either fine , dynamic
so this is just one example of a lot of a lot of many , and how adults can
but as i already think of how many authors come from the abalone analysis , our language does n't bring us a space , which we would like to have to , all we want to do with the person , to see
our language has been the social changes that has been happening in many cases that many of us could
and from the top of the walk , you can have heard that my legs , the unit of the suburbs , the networking , are actually not working with the social world , they 're actually going to be able to help themselves make a free identity , and they 're going to have a of the
so , in fact , this technological shift , it 's because there 's always a different part of life , and that there 's always a chance that there 's a person who can also make a difference between society , and very powerful , and that
so , the human change is very much -- this is an interesting story , because people will always ask me how i 'm going to do with sustainable research and i 'm always going to take you to a much -- and i 've always been to try to answer that sentence and i think , i think , i think i 'm going to understand why
this is the great part of a nuclear race with nuclear growth that success is based on , a task based on , to be able to do that -- because i would be able to get the idea of a life with a mistake or whatever always with me , with my disability to
but the truth is that we 're changing . we 're in the challenge of , you know , because of the great reason whether you 're a
and i just want you to say that that
and security is n't an amazing notion that we have to anticipate , so we have to be better
and ironically , it 's also just
